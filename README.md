Data Structures & Algorithms
========

This project are curated resources and notes of basic/fundamental/popular data strcutures and algorithms for software engineer to study, there are also some classic problems/solutions for each topics to practice after studying. You can study and practice by topics, enjoy this learning journey!!

> This project is working in progress and might contains my personal study progress. Feel free to fork (contribution is not available for now), remove them and keep the curated resources and notes as your study resource. Happy studying :) ðŸ’ª

## Roadmap
This is the recommended study path that you can follow from beginner level to intermediate level that the topics we cover in this project. Some topics are required to master prior to other topic, for example, we must master "graph" before studying "shortest path".
