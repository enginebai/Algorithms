Data Structures & Algorithms
========

This project offers a curated collection of notes and resources covering fundamental and widely used data structures and algorithms. It is designed to help software engineers to prepare for coding interviews and learn more about computer science. For each topic, we provide a set of LeetCode problems and their solutions to practice after studying. You can follow the study path from beginner to intermediate level from the roadmap below, making your learning journey both structured and enjoyable. Happy coding!!
