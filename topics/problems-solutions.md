## Clarification Questions
### General
* How big is the input size?
* What's the range of values? (negative? positive?)
* What's the input type? (integer, floating, strings...) and format?
* Is input sorted (ordered)? Will the input array be sorted?
* Is there any duplicate?
* How about repeating elements?
* What if there are multiple answers?
* What if there is no answer at all?
* Can we modify the input? (such as updating the references of node pointer in the linked list? or update the value of vertices in the graph?)
* Does the element present in the input? (`k` in the input range or present?)
* How is the input stored?

### Numbers
* Null
* 0
* Negative number
* Min / Max

### Array
* Is the array sorted?
* Are there duplicates in the array?

### String
* Null
* Empty
* Blank
* Cases: Upper / Lower
* What characters are possible?
* Duplicate characters

### Linked List
* Are there cycles in linked list or graph?
* Empty
* One node or two nodes

### Graph
* What's the range of `m` and `n`?
* What's the range of vertex value?
* Directed or undirected?
* Weighted or unweighted?
* Cycle or acyclic?
* Could vertices have negative values?
* Could edge weights be negative?
* Do all vertices have distince values?
