# Clarification Questions
## General
### Input
* What's the input type? (integer, floating, strings...) and format?
* What's the range of input size? (the array size, the number of tree nodes, etc.)
* **What's the range of input value?** (negative or positive, the array value)
* Is input sorted (ordered)? Will the input array be sorted?
* Is there any duplicate?
* Can I assume that all the input are valid?
* Can I modify the input?
* Does the element present (`target` or `k`) in the input? If not, what should I return?

### Output
* What is the expected format and type of output?
* What if there is no answer at all?
* What if there are multiple answers?
* Does the order of the output result matters? Or how should I sort them?
* What if the output is too large to return?

### Overall
* Are there any time or space complexity requirements or constraints?

## String
* What does `s` consist of? (Lowercase, uppercase, digits, spaces, special characters, etc.)
* Is there any duplicate character?

## Linked List
* Is it a singly or doubly linked list?
* Is there any cycle in the linked list?

## Graph
* How is the graph represented? Adjacency matrix or adjacency list?
* Is the graph weighted or unweighted?
* Is the graph directed or undirected?
* Cycle or acyclic?
* Is the graph a directed acyclic graph (DAG)?
* Is there any self loops?
* Could there be multiple edges between two vertices?
* Could edge weights be negative?
* Could the graph be disconnected?
