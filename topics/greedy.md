# Greedy
A *greedy algorithm* always makes the choice that looks best at the moment, it makes the *locally* optimal choice in the hope that it will lead to a *globally* optimal solution.

We shall consider a [dynamic programming](../topics/dynamic-programming.md) solution and show that we can always make greedy choices to arrival the optimal solution.
