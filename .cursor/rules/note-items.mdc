## Note Items

If I'm asking you to help modify or improve my notes, please provide the following sections and notes:

### Hints
- A lightweight nudge without revealing too much.
- If I get stuck, what hints would help me move forward? (Simulate real interview settings)

### Breakdowns
- Break down the problem into smaller, simpler sub-problems.
- Answer questions like: _"Can we solve a simpler version first?"_ or _"Can we divide the problem into smaller steps?"_

### Key Insights
- Share the intuitions and key observations that lead to different approaches.
- Explain _how to come up with the idea_. When is it a good idea to think of this technique? I want to know the thought process and train my instinct when encountering new problems.
- Mention if the problem matches a classic pattern like:
    - Kadane’s algorithm
    - Two-pointer template
    - Sliding window shrinking/growing
    - Typical DP states
    - Binary search on answer space
- For more complex problems, you can mention the mini-decision tree: "If X, try method A, if Y, try method B, otherwise try method C".

### Implementation
- If I already have an implementation, **please respect and keep it**, unless there is a clear better one to suggest.
- For each approach, provide both time and space complexity analysis.
- If I have an analysis already, please **check if it’s correct**.
- Please also search online to provide any popular different approach or implementation.

### Edge Cases
- List important, non-trivial edge cases (excluding obvious cases like empty input or one element, etc.)
- If there are known frequent mistakes (e.g., off-by-one errors in binary search), mention them.
- For each edge case:
    - Describe **why** it's tricky.
    - Describe **how** to avoid it in the current approach.

### Pitfalls
- Highlight corner cases or tricky scenarios that are easy to overlook.

### Similar Problems / Variants / Follow-ups
- Suggest related problems or variants.
- If I already have notes for that problem, please **link to my existing notes** instead of the LeetCode problem link.
- Ask it to check if the similar problems are truly related by the technique, not just by tag.
