## Overall
- I'm practicing LeetCode in **Kotlin**. Please always give me **Kotlin** solutions.
- Please **keep the Kotlin code simple and clean**, preferring interview-friendly style (no unnecessary Kotlin tricks or extension functions).
- For **binary search**, always use the inclusive search range: `while (left <= right)`.
- You must **search on `leetcode.com` and `leetcode.cn`**, find the most **popular and up-voted solutions**, **summarize them**, and **provide the best one**.
- If there are valuable insights from **up-voted comments** (in either Chinese or English), please also include them.
- Please **reference any related online resources** if helpful, and ensure the final solution is **correct (AC)** and **robust across edge cases**.
- Please use "two pointers", not "two-pointer" or "two-pointers" in any description.
