Suppose we the following recipes, ingredients and supplies:
```js
Recipes = [C, D]
Ingredients = [[A, B], [B, C]]
Supplies = [A, B]
```

For each recipe `recipes[i]`, we have the `ingredients[i]` that can make it, we take them as edges from ingredient to recipe:

```js
// Graph (visualization)
A, B => C
B, C => D
```

And we can use topological sort to find out what recipes can be made from our ingredients, supplies and even recipes we just have made it.

So we build the graph from ingredients and count the indegrees for every recipes, and run BFS.

## Topological Sort (BFS)
```kotlin
fun findAllRecipes(recipes: Array<String>, ingredients: List<List<String>>, supplies: Array<String>): List<String> {
    val graph = hashMapOf<String, HashSet<String>>()
    val indegrees = hashMapOf<String, Int>()
    for (i in 0 until ingredients.size) {
        for (ingredient in ingredients[i]) {
            if (!graph.containsKey(ingredient)) graph[ingredient] = HashSet<String>()
            graph[ingredient]!!.add(recipes[i])
        }   
        indegrees[recipes[i]] = ingredients[i].size
    }

    val queue = ArrayDeque<String>()
    for (supply in supplies) {
        queue.addLast(supply)
    }

    val results = mutableListOf<String>()
    while (queue.isNotEmpty()) {
        val current = queue.removeFirst()
        graph[current]?.forEach { r ->
            var indegree = indegrees[r]!!
            indegree--
            indegrees[r] = indegree

            // We can make it
            if (indegree == 0) {
                results.add(r)
                queue.addLast(r)
            }
        }
    }
    return results
}
```

* **Time Complexity**: `O(R*I + S + R)` = `O(R*I + S)` where `R`, `I`, `S` represent the number of recipes, ingredients and supplies.
* **Space Complexity**: `O(R*I + S)` for graph and queue.
