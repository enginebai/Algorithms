## [11. Container With Most Water](https://leetcode.com/problems/container-with-most-water/)

The max area might come from the following choices:
1. The widest
2. The highest

But we don't know if we have the highest height at specific moment, but we can start the widest choice at first, we put `left` and `right` two pointers at the first and the last position, this forms the widest container, but it doesn't guarantee that it's highest, so we move the pointers to find the max area, but how to move?

```js
[...8  .....  6...]
    L ->   <- R
```

**Keep the higher one and move the shorter one!!**

* If we move `left` (to right direction), the width becomes smaller, then it's impossible to become the max area.
* If we move `right` (to left direction), we *might* find the taller height later even if the width becomes smaller, it might be possible to find the max area.

So, we will move **the shorter-height** pointer!!

```js


i: 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8
v: 1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7
   L               R, min(1,7)*8, 8
     L             R, min(8,7)*7, 49
     L           R,   min(8,3)*6, 18
     L         R      min(8,8)*5, 40
       L       R      min(6,8)*4, 24
         L     R      min(2,8)*3, 6
           L   R      min(5,8)*2, 10
             L R      min(4,8)*1, 4

// Move right if the left == right
     L       R        min(8,4)*4, 16
     L     R          min(8,5)*3, 15
     L   R            min(8,2)*2, 4
     L R              min(8,6)*1, 6   
```

```kotlin
fun maxArea(height: IntArray): Int {
    var left = 0
    var right = height.size - 1
    var maxAmount = 0
    while (left < right) {
        val lowerHeight = min(height[left], height[right])
        val width = right - left
        maxAmount = max(maxAmount, lowerHeight * width)
        if (height[left] <= height[right]) {
            left++
        } else {
            right--
        }
    }
    return maxAmount
}
