## [11. Container With Most Water](https://leetcode.com/problems/container-with-most-water/)

The area = `min(h[i], h[j]) * (j - i)`
```js
  |
  |~~~~~~~|
| | | | | | | |
  i       j
```

The max area comes from the two choices:
1. The widest
2. The highest

**Idea!!** We start the widest choice at the first and the last position, move the two pointers `left -> ... <- right` , all other possible choices are less wide (width minus 1), to get a better solution, we need to choose a higher height. So we **drop (move) the pointer with the lower height** for further consideration which doesn't support higher height.

### Detail Explanation
How to move the two pointer? Which pointer should we move first?

```js
[... 999 ..... 6 ...]
      L ->  <- R
```

Suppose `left` = 999, `right` is 6, and width is `5`, let's consider the result of moving `left` and `right` pointer:

**Case 1.** We move higher height `left` pointer, we will meet the possible height in next round:
  * `2000` (higher height)
  * `999` (same height)
  * `8` (lower height)
the width becomes smaller which is `4`, the possible area is `4 * min(2000, 6)` / `4 * min(999, 6)` / `4 * min(8, 6)`, respectively, all possible height leads to smaller area. No matter what the next height is, **the area guarantees to be smaller than `5 * min(999, 6)`**.

**Case 2.** If we move smaller height `right` pointer, we *might* find the higher height later even if the width becomes smaller, it might be possible to find the larger area. If we don't meet higher height, then the current result `5 * min(999, 6)` would be the max area.

So, we conclude that we can move the pointer with the shorter height.

How about the equal height? We can move either one, neither `(left + 1, right)` or `(left, right - 1)` can be potential max area because the width is smaller and the area obtained is necessarily smaller than `(left, right)`. Or we can move both, it doesn't matter.

```js
// Move left if the left == right
i: 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8
v: 1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7
   L               R, min(1,7)*8, 8
     L             R, min(8,7)*7, 49
     L           R,   min(8,3)*6, 18
     L         R      min(8,8)*5, 40
       L       R      min(6,8)*4, 24
         L     R      min(2,8)*3, 6
           L   R      min(5,8)*2, 10
             L R      min(4,8)*1, 4

// Move right if the left == right
     L       R        min(8,4)*4, 16
     L     R          min(8,5)*3, 15
     L   R            min(8,2)*2, 4
     L R              min(8,6)*1, 6   
```

```kotlin
fun maxArea(height: IntArray): Int {
    var left = 0
    var right = height.size - 1
    var maxAmount = 0
    while (left < right) {
        val lowerHeight = min(height[left], height[right])
        val width = right - left
        maxAmount = maxOf(maxAmount, lowerHeight * width)

        // IT's fine for `height[left] <= height[right]``
        if (height[left] < height[right]) {
            left++
        } else {
            right--
        }

        // Or we can move both when the height is equal.
        // } else if (height[left] == height[right]) {
        //     left++
        //     right--
        // }
    }
    return maxAmount
}
```

* **Time Complexity**: `O(n)`, we only traverse the array once.
* **Space Complexity**: `O(1)`, we don't use any extra space.

We move the left or left pointer when the height of two sides are equal, here is some test cases:

```js
8 6 7 8
l     r = 8 * 3 ^^
  l   r = 6 * 2
    l r = 7 * 1

8 6 7 8
l     r = 8 * 3 ^^
l   r   = 7 * 2
l r     = 6 * 1

8 6 9 8
l     r = 8 * 3 ^^
  l   r = 6 * 2
    l r = 8 * 1

8 6 9 8
l     r = 8 * 3 ^^
l   r   = 8 * 2
  l r   = 6 * 1

4 6 7 4
l     r = 4 * 3 ^^
  l   r = 4 * 2
  l r   = 6 * 1

4 6 7 4
l     r = 4 * 3 ^^
l   r   = 4 * 2
  l r   = 6 * 1
```
