# [1887. Reduction Operations to Make the Array Elements Equal](https://leetcode.com/problems/reduction-operations-to-make-the-array-elements-equal/)

## Hints
- What happens if you sort the array? Can you process from smallest to largest or vice versa?
- Try to group the same numbers together and think about how many steps each group needs.

## Breakdowns
> 1. What is the minimum number of operations to make all elements equal?

- Each operation reduces the largest element to the next largest. If you sort the array, you can process from largest to smallest, counting how many times each unique value needs to be reduced to the next smaller value.

> 2. Can you use prefix sums or a running count to simplify the calculation?

- By iterating through the sorted array, you can accumulate the number of operations needed for each unique value.

## Greedy + Sorting
> TODO: Figure out this solution.
The key idea is to sort the array and count, for each unique value, how many operations are needed to reduce all larger values to it. Each time you encounter a new value, you increment the step count, and for every element, you add the current step count to the answer.

```kotlin
// Used in solutions
fun reductionOperations(nums: IntArray): Int {
    nums.sort()
    var ans = 0
    var steps = 0
    for (i in 1 until nums.size) {
        if (nums[i] != nums[i - 1]) {
            steps++
        }
        ans += steps
    }
    return ans
}
```
- **Time Complexity**: `O(N log N)`, where `N` is the length of `nums` (for sorting).
- **Space Complexity**: `O(1)` (in-place sort, constant extra space).

## Two Pointers
This problem is similar to the "group by consecutive" pattern, we can group the numbers `W, X, Y, Z` in descending order and count the number of elements in each group `a, b, c, d`:

```js
|---W---|---X---|---Y---|---Z---|
|---a---|---b---|---c---|---d---|
```

Then start the operation to reduce the largest to the second largest, second largest to the third largest, and so on until all the numbers are `Z` (the smallest number): 

1. We need `a` operations to make all `W` to `X`.

2. Next, we reduce all `X` to `Y`: We need `a + b` operations to make all `X` to `Y`.

3. Finally, we reduce all `Y` to `Z`: We need `a + b + c` operations to make all `Y` to `Z`.

So the total number of operations is `a + (a + b) + (a + b + c)`.

```js
|---W---|---X---|---Y---|---Z---|

// Reduce all `W` to `X`
|-------X-------|---Y---|---Z---|

// Reduce all `X` to `Y`
|---------------Y-------|---Z---|
|

// Reduce all `Y` to `Z`
|-----------------------Z-------|
```

```kotlin
fun reductionOperations(nums: IntArray): Int {
    val n = nums.size
    nums.sortDescending()
    val last = nums.last()
    var i = 0
    var ans = 0
    var count = 0
    while (i < n) {
        var start = i
        if (nums[start] == last) break
        i++
        while (i < n && nums[i] == nums[start]) {
            i++
        }
        count += (i - start)
        ans += count
    }
    return ans
}
```
Or equivalently, we sort the array in ascending order and count the number of elements in each group `a, b, c, d`, but we need to track the level of the operation:

```js
W, X, Y, Z // ascending order
a, b, c, d // count
0  1  2  3 // level
         d // Change all `Z` to `X`
      c, d // Change all `Y` to `X`
   b, c, d // Change all `X` to `Y`
```
The total number of operations is: `b + 2 * c + 3 * d`.

```kotlin
fun reductionOperations(nums: IntArray): Int {
    val n = nums.size
    nums.sort()
    var i = 0
    var ans = 0
    var level = 0
    while (i < n) {
        var start = i
        i++
        while (i < n && nums[i] == nums[start]) {
            i++
        }
        ans += level * (i - start)
        level++
    }
    return ans
}
```

- **Time Complexity**: `O(N log N)`
- **Space Complexity**: `O(1)`

## WA
```kotlin
fun reductionOperations(nums: IntArray): Int {
    val n = nums.size
    nums.sortDescending()
    val last = nums.last()
    var i = 0
    var ans = 0
    while (i < n) {
        var start = i
        if (nums[start] == last) break
        i++
        while (i < n && nums[i] == nums[start]) {
            i++
        }
        // Wrong here
        ans += ans + (i - start)
    }
    return ans
}
```

## Edge Cases
- All elements are already equal: answer is `0`.
- Only two unique values: answer is the count of the larger value.
- Large input with many duplicates: make sure to group correctly and avoid overcounting.
