# [636. Exclusive Time of Functions](https://leetcode.com/problems/exclusive-time-of-functions/description/)

## Test Cases
### Edge Cases
* Deeply nested calls: `A:start:0`, `A:start:1`, `A:start:2`, ..., `A:end:9`, `A:end:10`, `A:end:11`
* Back-to-back calls: `A:start:0`, `A:end:1`, `A:start:2`, `A:end:3`, `A:start:4`, `A:end:5`
* Single call: `A:start:0`, `A:end:5`
* Long gap between calls: `A:start:0`, `A:start:100`, `A:end:200`, `A:end:300`

## Breakdowns
> 1. How to calculate the exclusive time of each function?

It's `end - start + 1`.

> 2. If the functions calls are sequential, how to calculate the exclusive time of each function?

```js
n = 2
logs = ["0:start:0", "0:end:5", "1:start:6", "1:end:8"]
Output: [6, 3]

------A-----> --B-->
|           | |    |
0           5 6    8
```

## Stack
For the single function call, we just calculate the time between the start and end time: the exclusive time of A is `9 - 0 + 1 = 10`.
```js
A: ---------------->
   |               |
   0               9     
```

If we have two function calls, the exclusive time of A is 10 (from previous example) but function A was blocked when executing function B. In other words, **function A has to lend the time to B when B starts**. The exclusive time of B is `7 - 2 + 1 = 6`, so A has to lend 6 to B, and the exclusive time of A is `10 - 6 = 4`.
```js
B:    --------->     
      |        |
A: ---------------->
   |  |        |   |
   0  2        7   9  
```

As new functions are called, we have to lend the time from the current function to the new function. (No matter the new function is the same function or a different function, or how many nested functions are called.)
The exclusive time of the current function is the time between the start and end time minus the time lent to the new function.

```js
       |-- C --|
    |----- B -----|
|----------A---------|
t[A]: (A.end - A.start + 1) - t[B] // Total time of A - time lent to B
t[B]: (B.end - B.start + 1) - t[C] // Total time of B - time lent to C
t[C]: C.end - C.start + 1
```

Please note that we have the same calculation for the recursive function call, the difference is that we lend the time to the same function call.

**Idea!!** We use a stack to track function execution order (handing nested calls) and deduct time spent in nested calls. When a function starts, we push the function call to the stack. When a function ends, we pop the function call from the stack. We calculate the exclusive time of the current function and deduct the time to the previous function call.

> The log is structured and ordered:
>
> ```
> id: A, start, 0
> id: B, start, 2
> id: C, start 3
> id: C, end, 4
> id: B, end, 7
> id: A, end, 9
> ```

```kotlin
fun exclusiveTime(n: Int, logs: List<String>): IntArray {
    val times = IntArray(n)
    val calls = logs.map {
        val log = it.split(":")
        Call(log[0].toInt(), log[1] == "start", log[2].toInt())
    }        
    val stack = Stack<Call>()
    for (i in calls.indices) {
        val log = calls[i]
        if (log.isStart) {
            stack.push(log)
        } else {
            val currentCall = stack.pop()
            val executeTime = (log.timestamp - currentCall.timestamp + 1)
            times[currentCall.id] += executeTime
            // If we suspend the previous function, we have to deduct the time from the previous function
            if (stack.isNotEmpty()) {
                vall previousCall = stack.peek()
                times[previousCall.id] -= executeTime
            }
        }
    }
    return times
}
```

* **Time Complexity:** `O(n)`, where `n` is the number of logs.
* **Space Complexity:** `O(n)`.
