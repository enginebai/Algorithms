# [636. Exclusive Time of Functions](https://leetcode.com/problems/exclusive-time-of-functions/description/)

## Stack
For the single function call, we just calculate the time between the start and end time: the exclusive time of A is 9 - 0 + 1 = 10.
```js
A: ---------------->
   |               |
   0               9     
```

If we have two function calls, the exclusive time of A is 10 (from previous example) but function A was blocked when executing function B. In other words, **function A has to lend the time to B when B starts**. The exclusive time of B is 7 - 2 + 1 = 6, so A has to lend 6 to B, and the exclusive time of A is 10 - 6 = 4.
```js
B:    --------->     
      |        |
A: ---------------->
   |  |        |   |
   0  2        7   9  
```

As new functions are called, we have to lend the time from the current function to the new function. (No matter the new function is the same function or a different function, or how many nested functions are called.)
The exclusive time of the current function is the time between the start and end time minus the time lent to the new function.

```js
       |-- C --|
    |----- B -----|
|----------A---------|
t[A]: (A.end - A.start + 1) - t[B] // Total time of A - time lent to B
t[B]: (B.end - B.start + 1) - t[C] // Total time of B - time lent to C
t[C]: C.end - C.start + 1
```

Please note that we have the same calculation for the recursive function call, the difference is that we lend the time to the same function call.

```kotlin
fun exclusiveTime(n: Int, logs: List<String>): IntArray {
    val times = IntArray(n)
    val calls = logs.map {
        val log = it.split(":")
        Call(log[0].toInt(), log[1] == "start", log[2].toInt())
    }        
    val stack = Stack<Call>()
    for (i in 0 until calls.size) {
        val log = calls[i]
        if (log.isStart) {
            stack.push(log)
        } else {
            val currentCall = stack.pop()
            val executeTime = (log.timestamp - currentCall.timestamp + 1)
            times[currentCall.id] += executeTime
            if (stack.isNotEmpty()) {
                vall previousCall = stack.peek()
                times[previousCall.id] -= executeTime
            }
        }
    }
    return times
}
```

* **Time Complexity:** `O(n)`, where `n` is the number of logs.
* **Space Complexity:** `O(n)`.
