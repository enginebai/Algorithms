# [26. Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-duplicates-from-sorted-array/)

## Two Pointers
It's sorted array, the duplicate will be always adjacent, we can use two pointers to solve this problem.

We can use `read` and `write` pointer to check the duplicate and remove it. We iterate all elements by `read` pointer, and if it is not duplicate, then write to the `write` pointer.

```js
[1, 2, 2, 2]
// 1st iteration
[1, 2, 2, 2]
    R
    W
// 2nd iteration
[1, 2, 2, 2]
       R
       W
// 3rd iteration
[1, 2, 2, 2]
          R
       W 
```

```python
def removeDuplicates(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
    read = 1
    # It's the next position to write
    write = 1
    while read < len(nums):
        if nums[write - 1] != nums[read]:
            nums[write] = nums[read]
            write += 1
        read += 1
    return write

# Or different definition of write pointer
def removeDuplicates(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
    read = 1
    # The current written position 
    write = 0
    while read < len(nums):
        if nums[write] != nums[read]:
            write += 1
            nums[write] = nums[read]
        read += 1
    return write + 1
```

```kotlin
fun removeDuplicates(nums: IntArray): Int {
    var write = 1
    for (read in 1 until nums.size) {
        if (nums[write - 1] != nums[read]) {
            nums[write++] = nums[read]
        }
    }
    return write
}
```

* **Time Complexity**: `O(n)` for only one for-loop.
* **Space Complexity**: `O(1)` for modify the array in-place.
