    val visited = hashSetOf<Pair<Int, Int>>()
    val queue = ArrayDeque<Pair<Int, Int>>()
    var minutes = 0        
    
    val directions = arrayOf(
        -1 to 0,
        1 to 0,
        0 to -1,
        0 to 1
    )
    var freshCount = 0
    for (m in 0 until grid.size) {
        for (n in 0 until grid[m].size) {
            if (grid[m][n] == 2) {
                visited.add(m to n)
                directions.forEach { direction ->
                    val newM = m + direction.first
                    val newN = n + direction.second
                    queue.addLast(newM to newN)

            } else if (grid[m][n] == 1) {
                freshCount++
            }
        }
    }
    // No rotten orange and has fresh orange, it's impossible to rot.
    if (queue.isEmpty() && freshCount > 0) return -1
    
    while (!queue.isEmpty()) {
        val size = queue.size
        var rotten = false

        // To rot at the same level
        for (i in 0 until size) {
            val node = queue.removeFirst()
            val x = node.first
            val y = node.second
            
            if (!(x in 0 until grid.size 
                    && y in 0 until grid[x].size 
                    && !visited.contains(x to y)
                    && grid[x][y] == 1)) continue
            
            grid[x][y] = 2
            freshCount--
            rotten = true
            visited.add(x to y)
            
            directions.forEach { d ->
                val newX = x + d.first
                val newY = y + d.second
                queue.addLast(newX to newY)
            }
        }

        // There might be no any valid position or fresh orange to rot, the time should not be incremented
        if (rotten) minutes++
    }
    
    return if (freshCount > 0) -1 else minutes
}
```

> There are some different ways to implement (with visited or not), just mind the way to enque, how to keep track of visited node, when to increment the minutes!!

### Failed Case
The two `1` will be enqueued at the first round, but the second `1` will be enqueued again and that have been rotten at the first round if we don't keep track of visited nodes (not enqueued), that will lead to wrong minutes accumulation. The second `1` will be enqued but it does not be ACTUALLY rotten at all.
