# [859. Buddy Strings](https://leetcode.com/problems/buddy-strings/description/)

There are some possible scenarios:
* The two strings have different lengths.
* `s == goal`: See below
* diff(s, goal) = 1: False, `ab, aa`.
* diff(s, goal) = 2: Check if the two different characters can be swapped.
* diff(s, goal) > 2: False

This problem has a very particular edge case: `aa` and `aa`. In this case, we can swap the two `a`s and get the same string. The two `a's` are considered as the different characters. So we can swap them and get the same string.

## Count the Difference
```kotlin
fun buddyStrings(s: String, goal: String): Boolean {
    if (s.length != goal.length) return false

    // Handle the special edge case, if there are (multiple) duplicate characters when s == goal
    // s = "aa"
    // goal = "aa"
    if (s == goal) {
        val count = IntArray(26)
        for (c in s) {
            count[c - 'a']++
            if (count[c - 'a'] > 1) return true
        }
        return false
    }

    // Otherwise, we need to find the two different characters
    var diff1: Pair<Char, Char>? = null
    var diff2: Pair<Char, Char>? = null
    for (i in 0 until s.length) {
        if (s[i] != goal[i]) {
            if (diff1 == null) diff1 = s[i] to goal[i]
            else if (diff2 == null) diff2 = s[i] to goal[i]
            else {
                // More than 2 differences
                return false
            }
        }
    }
    if (diff1 != null && diff2 != null) {
        // Check if we can swap the two different characters
        return diff1.first == diff2.second && diff1.second == diff2.first
    } else {
        // Less than 2 differences
        return false
    }
}
```
