## [986. Interval List Intersections](https://leetcode.com/problems/interval-list-intersections)

We can apply the two pointers to the two list, and compare one by one to see if they are overlapped, if yes, try to find the interaction. The key point is to move the pointer with smaller end, because the larger end has higher chances to overlap with the subsequent intervals.

To find the intersection of two intervals, we can compare the two intervals to see if they are overlapped. If they are overlapped, we can find the intersection by taking the maximum of the two start points and the minimum of the two end points.
```js
|-------|       a
    |------|    b
    |---|       intersection = max(a.start, b.start) to min(a.end, b.end)
```

```kotlin
fun intervalIntersection(firstList: Array<IntArray>, secondList: Array<IntArray>): Array<IntArray> {
    val results = mutableListOf<IntArray>()
    if (firstList.isEmpty() || secondList.isEmpty()) return results.toTypedArray()

    var p1 = 0
    var p2 = 0
    while (p1 < firstList.size && p2 < secondList.size) {
        val first = firstList[p1]
        val second = secondList[p2]

        val notOverlapped = 
            first[1] < second[0] || 
            second[1] < first[0] 
        if (!notOverlapped) {
                results.add(intArrayOf(
                    maxOf(first[0], second[0]),
                    minOf(first[1], second[1])
                ))
        }
        // Move one pointer with smaller end, keep the larger end that 
        // has higher chances to overlap with the subsequent intervals.

        // This is applicable to the two intervals that are overlapped or not.
        if (first[1] < second[1]) p1++
        else p2++
    }
    return results.toTypedArray()
}
```

* **Space Complexity**: `O(m + n)`.
