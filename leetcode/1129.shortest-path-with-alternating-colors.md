# [1129. Shortest Path with Alternating Colors](https://leetcode.com/problems/shortest-path-with-alternating-colors/)

## Hints
- What if you ignore the color alternation? How would you find the shortest path?
- How can you represent the state so that you don't revisit the same node with the same previous color?
- Why do you need to track the color of the previous edge in your BFS state?

## Breakdowns
> 1. How to calculate the shortest path from `0` to `i`?

Start BFS from `0`, and maintain a distance array for each node.

> 2. How to know the color of the edge for node `i`?

Convert the edge lists to two adjacency lists: one for red edges, one for blue edges.
```js
var red[i] = set(...)
var blue[i] = set(...)
```

> 3. How to alternate color along the path?

Record the color of the previous edge in the BFS state, and only traverse edges of the opposite color next.
```js
node.color = !node.color
```

> 4. How to know there is no such path?

Initialize the distance as `inf` (or `Int.MAX_VALUE`), then if it remains `inf` after traversal, it is unreachable.

## BFS with Color State
- This is a classic BFS shortest path problem, but with an extra state: the color of the previous edge.
- The key is to treat `(node, previous color)` as the BFS state, because you can revisit the same node if you arrive via a different color.
- You need two visited arrays (or a 2D visited array): one for red, one for blue, to avoid revisiting the same node with the same color.
- This pattern is similar to other BFS problems with extra state, such as [1293. Shortest Path in a Grid with Obstacles Elimination](1293.shortest-path-in-a-grid-with-obstacles-elimination.md), where the state includes remaining eliminations.
- BFS guarantees the shortest path is found first for each state.

data class MyNode(
    val index: Int,
    val isRed: Boolean, // true if the previous edge is red, false if blue
    val distance: Int
)

fun shortestAlternatingPaths(n: Int, redEdges: Array<IntArray>, blueEdges: Array<IntArray>): IntArray {
    // We conver to adjacency list or red and blue edges
    val redAdj = convert(n, redEdges)

    val distances = IntArray(n) { Int.MAX_VALUE }

    // We can't use a single visited array, because we have to alternate the color
    val redVisited = BooleanArray(n)
    val blueVisited = BooleanArray(n)

    // Start from 0, and add the red and blue edges to the queue
    queue.addLast(MyNode(0, true, 0))
    queue.addLast(MyNode(0, false, 0))
    redVisited[0] = true
    blueVisited[0] = true

    // Or equivalently, we can add the red and blue edges to the queue

                }
            }
        }
    }
    // If the distance is still `inf`, then it is impossible to reach
    for (i in 0 until n) {

- **Time Complexity**: `O(N + Red + Blue)`, where `N` is the number of nodes, and `Red`/`Blue` are the number of red/blue edges.
- **Space Complexity**: `O(N + Red + Blue)` for adjacency lists and visited arrays.

## Edge Cases
- If there are no outgoing edges from `0`, all other nodes are unreachable.
- If a node can only be reached by two consecutive edges of the same color, it is unreachable.
- Self-loops and parallel edges: the algorithm handles them naturally, as long as you track visited by color.
- If the graph is disconnected, unreachable nodes should return `-1`.

## Pitfalls
- Forgetting to track visited status separately for red and blue arrivals can lead to infinite loops or incorrect answers.
- Not alternating colors correctly when traversing edges.
- Updating the distance for a node without considering the color state can cause wrong results.
- **Mistake**: Using a single visited array for all states (should be per color).
- **Mistake**: Not initializing both red and blue starts from node `0`.
