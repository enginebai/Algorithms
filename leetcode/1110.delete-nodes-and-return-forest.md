# [1110. Delete Nodes And Return Forest](https://leetcode.com/problems/delete-nodes-and-return-forest/)

## Clarification Questions
* Does the `to_delete` array contain the node that does not exist in the tree?
 
## Test Cases
### Normal Cases
```
Input: 
        1               
     /     \      
    3       5          
  /   \    / \
 8    9   7   0   
         /   / 
        2   6   
delete = [5]
Output: 
        1               
     /          
    3                 
  /   \    
 8    9   7   0   
         /   / 
        2   6  
```
### Edge / Corner Cases
* The nodes to delete are in the same subtree.
```
Input: 
        1               
     /     \      
    3       5          
  /   \    / \
 8    9   7   0   
         /   / 
        2   6  
delete = [1,5]
Output: 
    3               
  /   \    
 8    9   7   0   
         /   / 
        2   6  
```

## Postorder 
**Idea!!** We can traverse the tree, if the current node is in the delete list, we can add its children to the forest.

```js
        1       del(1)
     /     \
    2       3
  ...       ...

// After delete `1`, the subtrees `2` and `3` become the forest.
     /     \
    2       3
  ...       ...
```
We use postorder to delete, because we need to delete the nodes from the bottom to the top. Here is one key point to note, if the original root is not in the delete list, we should add it to the forest first.
```kotlin
fun delNodes(root: TreeNode?, to_delete: IntArray): List<TreeNode?> {
    val set = HashSet<Int>()
    for (d in to_delete) set.add(d)
    val forest = mutableListOf<TreeNode?>()
    // If the root is not in the delete list, add it to the forest first.
    if (!set.contains(root?.`val`)) forest.add(root)
    delete(root, set, forest)
    return forest
}

private fun delete(root: TreeNode?, deleteSet: HashSet<Int>, forest: MutableList<TreeNode?>): TreeNode? {
    if (root == null) return null

    root.left = delete(root.left, deleteSet, forest)
    root.right = delete(root.right, deleteSet, forest)
    if (deleteSet.contains(root.`val`)) {
        if (root.left != null) forest.add(root.left)
        if (root.right != null) forest.add(root.right)
        return null
    }
    return root
}
```

* **Space Complexity:** `O(n)`
