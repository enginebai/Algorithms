fun candy(ratings: IntArray): Int {
    var result = IntArray(ratings.size) { 1 }
    for (i in 1 until ratings.size) {
        if (ratings[i] > ratings[i - 1]) {
            result[i] = result[i - 1] + 1
        }
    }
    for (i in ratings.size - 1 downTo 1) {
        if (ratings[i - 1] > ratings[i]) {
            result[i - 1] = maxOf(result[i] + 1, result[i - 1])
        }
    }

    var count = 0
    for (num in result) {
        count += num
    }
    return count
