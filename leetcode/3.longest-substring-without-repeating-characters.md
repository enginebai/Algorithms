# [3. Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-substring-without-repeating-characters/)

## Test Cases
### Normal Cases
```
Input: s = "abcadefga"
Output: 7
Explanation: The longest substring without repeating characters is "bcadefg".

Input: s = "ababca"
Output: 3
```
### Edge / Corner Cases
* Every character is the same.
```
Input: s = "aaaaa"
Output: 1
```

## Sliding Window
* Window: the longest substring without repeating characters.
* We extend our window one by one to see (moving `right` pointer) if character repeats, if it has repeating character then we shrink the window by moving `left` pointer.

```kotlin
private val offset = ' '

fun lengthOfLongestSubstring(s: String): Int {
    var left = 0
    var right = 0
    val sCounts = IntArray(128)
    var result = 0
    while (right < s.length) {
        sCounts[s[right] - offset]++
        while (sCounts[s[right] - offset] > 1) {
            sCounts[s[left] - offset]--
            left++
        }
        result = maxOf(result, right - left + 1)
        right++
    }
    return result
}

// Or equivalently using set
fun lengthOfLongestSubstring(s: String): Int {
    val set = HashSet<Char>()
    var left = 0
    var maxLen = 0
    for (right in 0 until s.length) {
        // We have to check before adding the right element to the set
        while (set.contains(s[right])) {
            set.remove(s[left])
            left++
        }
        // We add after checking
        set.add(s[right])
        maxLen = maxOf(maxLen, right - left + 1)
    }
    return maxLen
}
```

* **Time Complexity**: `O(n)`, Sliding Window iterates every character exactly once.
* **Space Complexity**: `O(k)`, `k` represents the number of different characters.
