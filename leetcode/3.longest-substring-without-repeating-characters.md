# [3. Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-substring-without-repeating-characters/)

## Clarification Questions
* No, it's clear from problem description.

## Test Cases
### Normal Cases
```
Input: s = "abcadefga"
Output: 7
Explanation: The longest substring without repeating characters is "bcadefg".

Input: s = "ababca"
Output: 3
```
### Edge / Corner Cases
* Every character is the same.
```
Input: s = "aaaaa"
Output: 1
```

## Sliding Window
* Window: the longest substring without repeating characters.
* We extend our window one by one to see (moving `right` pointer) if character repeats, if it repeats then move `left` pointer by one and check from new start.

```kotlin
private val offset = ' '

fun lengthOfLongestSubstring(s: String): Int {
    var left = 0
    var right = 0
    val sCounts = IntArray(128)
    var result = 0
    while (right < s.length) {
        sCounts[s[right] - offset]++
        while (sCounts[s[right] - offset] > 1) {
            sCounts[s[left] - offset]--
            left++
        }
        result = max(result, right - left + 1)
        right++
    }
    return result
}
```

* **Time Complexity**: `O(n)`, Sliding Window iterates every character exactly once.
* **Space Complexity**: `O(k)`, `k` represents the number of different characters.
