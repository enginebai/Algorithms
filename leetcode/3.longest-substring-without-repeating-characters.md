## [3. Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-substring-without-repeating-characters/)

### Sliding Window
* Window: the longest substring without repeating characters.
* We extend our window one by one to see (moving `end` index) if character repeats, if it repeats then move `start` index by one and check from new start.

```kotlin
fun lengthOfLongestSubstring(s: String): Int {
    var maxLength = 0
    var currentLength = 0
    val seenSet = hashSetOf<Char>()
    var start = 0
    var end = 0

    while (end < s.length) {
        if (seenSet.contains(s[end])) {
            currentLength = 0
            start++
            end = start
            seenSet.clear()
        }
        seenSet.add(s[end])
        currentLength++
        end++

        if (currentLength > maxLength) {
            maxLength = currentLength
        }
    }
    return maxLength
}
```

### Failed Cases
```js
"bbb" -> "b" // inifinite loop
"babc" -> "abc" // wrong start index, I originally move `start` index to `end`.
```
