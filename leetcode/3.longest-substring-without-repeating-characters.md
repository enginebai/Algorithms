## [3. Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-substring-without-repeating-characters/)

### Sliding Windows
* Window: the longest substring without repeating characters.
* We extend our window one by one to see (moving `end` pointer) if character repeats, if it repeats then move `start` pointer by one and check from new start.

```kotlin
fun lengthOfLongestSubstring(s: String): Int {
    var maxLength = 0
    var start = 0
    var end = 0
    val countSet = hashSetOf<Char>()
    while (end < s.length) {
        while (countSet.contains(s[end])) {
            countSet.remove(s[start])
            start++
        }   
        val currentLength = end - start + 1
        maxLength = if (currentLength > maxLength) currentLength else maxLength
            
        countSet.add(s[end])
        end++
    }
    return maxLength
}
```

* **Time Complexity**: `O(n)`, sliding windows iterates every character exactly once.
* **Space Complexity**: `O(k)`, `k` represents the number of different characters.
