# [1094. Car Pooling](https://leetcode.com/problems/car-pooling)

## Line Sweep
We pick up people at `from` and drop them off at `to`, we need to check if the car ever picks up too many people at any moment. Suppose `a[i]` respresents the number of people picked up at the `i-th` location, and we have to make sure that `a[i] <= capacity`. If there is passenger `numPassengers` picked up at location `from` and dropped off at location `to`, we have to add `numPassengers` to `a[from..to - 1]`.

Instead of tracking every single location, we **only mark changes**, we can use a [line sweep](../topics/interval.md#line-sweep) to track the passenger count at the moment that people were picked up and dropped off the car:
* At `from`, we increase the passenger count `d[start] += passengers`.
* At `to`, we decrease the passenger count `d[end] -= passengers`.

In this way, we only record **changes** (*difference array*) at two locations instead of making every location.

For example, `trips = [[3,2,5],[2,3,7]]`:
1. 3 people get on the car at location 2 and drop off at location 5.
2. 2 people get on the car at location 3 and drop off at location 7.

| Location | Change of `d` | Current People |
|----------|---------------|----------------|
| 1        |  0            | 0              |
| 2        | +3            | 3              |
| 3        | +2            | 5              |
| 4        |  0            | 5              |
| 5        | -3            | 2              | 
| 6        |  0            | 2              |
| 7        | -2            | 0              |

Now we have the difference array `d = [0, 3, 2, 0, -3, 0, -2]`, and we can recover `a[i]` by adding up `d` from left to right `a = [0, 3, 5, 5, 2, 2, 0]`. We can check if the car ever picks up too many people at any moment by checking if `a[i] > capacity`.

> 起始先用 nums 来作为差分数组，对于 trips[i]=(c,a,b)，有 c 个乘客在 a 点上车，在 b 点下车，因此对 [a,b) 进行整体加 c 操作，对应差分数组操作 nums[a] += c; nums[b] -= c。 处理完 trips 后，对差分数组 nums 进行前缀计算（可直接复用 nums，进行原地计算），便可得到各个站点的乘客数量，与 capacity 比较得出答案。

```js
1 2 3 4 5 6 7
|-------|      // 2 people
    |-------|  // 3 people
      |---|    // 1 person
*              // Car starts to pick up people

// At 1, capacity - 2
// At 3, capacity - 3
// At 4, capacity - 1
// At 5, capacity + 2
// ...so on.
```

```python
def carPooling(self, trips: List[List[int]], capacity: int) -> bool:
    occupancy = [0] * 1001
    for trip in trips:
        passengers, start, end = trip
        occupancy[start] += passengers
        occupancy[end] -= passengers

    for i in range(len(occupancy)):
        capacity -= occupancy[i]
        if capacity < 0: return False
    return True
```

```kotlin
fun carPooling(trips: Array<IntArray>, capacity: Int): Boolean {
    // We use TreeMap to sort the `from` index
    // because the car only drives east (i.e., it cannot turn around and drive west).
    // 我们只需要考虑在 from[i] 和 to[i] 之间的乘客数，其余位置的乘客是保持不变的，无需考虑。
    // 平衡树可以保证我们是从小到大遍历这些位置的。当然，如果你不想用平衡树的话，也可以用哈希表，把哈希表的 key 取出来排序，就可以从小到大遍历这些位置了。
    val pickupMap = TreeMap<Int, Int>()
    for (trip in trips) {
        val (passengers, from, to) = trip
        pickupMap[from] = (pickupMap[from] ?: 0) + passengers
        pickupMap[to] = (pickupMap[to] ?: 0) - passengers
    }
    var pickup = capacity
    for ((k,v) in pickupMap.entries) {
        pickup += v
        if (pickup > capacity) return false
    }
    return true
}
```
* **Time Complexity:** `O(n log n)`
* **Space Complexity:** `O(n)`

        }
