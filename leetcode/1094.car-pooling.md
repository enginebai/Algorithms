## [1094. Car Pooling](https://leetcode.com/problems/car-pooling)

We will decrease the capacity at `from` (pick up the passenger) and increase back the capacity at `to` (the passenger gets off). Or we will increase the passenger count at `from` and decrease the passenger count at `to`.

```js
3    5, 2 people
|----|

// Capacity - 2 at index 3, 2 people get on the car.
// Capacity + 2 at index 5, 2 people get off the car.
```

```js
1 2 3 4 5 6 7
|-------|      // 2 people
    |-------|  // 3 people
      |---|    // 1 person
*              // Car starts to pick up people

// At 1, capacity - 2
// At 3, capacity - 3
// At 4, capacity - 1
// At 5, capacity + 2
// ...so on.
```

```python
def carPooling(self, trips: List[List[int]], capacity: int) -> bool:
    occupancy = [0] * 1001
    for trip in trips:
        passengers, start, end = trip
        occupancy[start] += passengers
        occupancy[end] -= passengers

    for i in range(len(occupancy)):
        capacity -= occupancy[i]
        if capacity < 0: return False
    return True
```

```kotlin
fun carPooling(trips: Array<IntArray>, capacity: Int): Boolean {
    /// We use TreeMap to sort the `from` index
    val pickupMap = TreeMap<Int, Int>()
    for (trip in trips) {
        val passengers = trip[0]
        val from = trip[1]
        val to = trip[2]
        pickupMap[from] = (pickupMap[from] ?: 0) + passengers
        pickupMap[to] = (pickupMap[to] ?: 0) - passengers
    }
    var pickup = capacity
    for ((k,v) in pickupMap.entries) {
        pickup -= v
        if (pickup < 0) return false
    }
    return true
}
