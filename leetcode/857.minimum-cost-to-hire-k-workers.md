# [857. Minimum Cost to Hire K Workers](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-cost-to-hire-k-workers/)

## Heap
We want to hire `k` workers, all hired workers must be paid based on the **same wage-to-quality ratio** (`wage[i] / quality[i]` is the same for all workers), and at least paid the `wage[i]` for each worker. Our goal is to find the minimum cost to hire `k` workers.

1. Pay = ratio * quality, all workders must be paid based on the same ratio.
2. To satisfy teach worker's minimum wage, the ratio must be at least `wage[i] / quality[i]`.
3. If we fix a ratio, we can:
    - Pay that ratio to all workers, and the cost is `ratio * qualitySum`
    - Pick `k` workers whose **total quality** is smallest to minimize the cost.

Steps:
1. We compute the ratio for each worker.
2. Sort the workers by the ratio: The worker with smaller ratio is cheaper to use as the baseline.
3. Iterate through the workers:
    - For each worker as the **current highest ratio**.
    - Maintain `k` smallest qualitieis in the heap.
    - The cost is `ratio * qualitySum`
4. Return the minimum cost.

```kotlin
data class Worker(
    val quality: Int,
    val wage: Int
) {
    val ratio: Double = wage * 1.0 / quality
}

fun mincostToHireWorkers(quality: IntArray, wage: IntArray, k: Int): Double {
    val n = quality.size
    val workers = Array(n) { Worker(quality[it], wage[it]) }
    workers.sortBy { it.ratio }

    val maxHeap = PriorityQueue<Int>(compareByDescending { it })
    var qualitySum = 0
    var minCost = Double.MAX_VALUE
    for (worker in workers) {
        maxHeap.add(worker.quality)
        qualitySum += worker.quality

        if (maxHeap.size > k) {
            qualitySum -= maxHeap.poll()
        }
        if (maxHeap.size == k) {
            minCost = minOf(minCost, qualitySum * worker.ratio)
        }
    }
    return minCost
}
