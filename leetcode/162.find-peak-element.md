## [162. Find Peak Element](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-peak-element/description/)

**Idea!!** We start to walk toward the higher grand from any position, then we will arrive at the peak eventually. (`人往高處爬，水往低處流`) We can apply this idea with binary search. There are three cases when choosing the `middle`:

1. The `middle` is the peak: We just return the current index.
```js
   M 
 /   \
/     \
```

2. The peak is at the left part: Then we go to the left part.
```js
 Peak 
 /   \
/     \
       M 
        \ 
```
3. The peak is at the right part: Then we go to the right part.
```js
   Peak
  /   \
 /     \
M
```

How about the case that the `middle` is the lowest point? Then it's fine to go left or right, because we will eventually arrive at the peak.

```js
\    /
 \  /
   M   
```

```kotlin
fun findPeakElement(nums: IntArray): Int {
    // Edge case: size == 1, then it's the peak
    if (nums.size <= 1) return 0
    
    val n = nums.size

    // Two corner cases: the first and the last element is the peek
    if (nums[0] > nums[1]) return 0
    if (nums[n - 2] < nums[n - 1]) return n - 1

    // Then we search the rest range of array
    var left = 1
    var right = n - 2
    while (left <= right) {
        val middle = left + (right - left) / 2
        // Case 1. Peak is at middle
        if (nums[middle - 1] < nums[middle] && nums[middle] > nums[middle + 1]) return middle
        // Case 2. Peak is at right part
        else if (nums[middle] < nums[middle + 1]) left = middle + 1
        // Case 3. Peak is at left part
        else if (nums[middle - 1] > nums[middle]) right = middle - 1
    }
    // Dummy return
    return -1
}
```
