# [945. Minimum Increment to Make Array Unique](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-increment-to-make-array-unique/)

## Greedy
We must increment the smallest to the largest nubmer in order, so we can sort the array first. Then we can set the expected number and calculate the increment needed for each number. If the number is already larger than the expected number, we can just "jump" the expected number. Otherwise, we need to increment the number to the expected number and update the expected number.

```js
values:     5, 5, 6
expected:   5, 6, 7
increment:  0  1  1

values:     5, 5, 8, 9
expected:   5, 6, 8, 9 // We jump from 6 to 8
increment:  0  1  0  0
```

```kotlin
fun minIncrementForUnique(nums: IntArray): Int {
    nums.sort()
    var expected = nums.first() + 1
    var increment = 0
    for (i in 1 until nums.size) {
        if (nums[i] < expected) {
            increment += (expected - nums[i])
            expected++
        } else {
            expected = nums[i] + 1
        }
    }
    return increment
}
```
