## Traversal
To find the closed island, we can find non-closed islands first, then find the closed islands. How can we find the non-closed islands? We can start searching from the edges of the grid, the islands which are connected to the edges are non-closed islands. We can mark them as invalid during traversal. Then we can find the closed islands by traversing the grid again.

* We traversal (either DFS or BFS) from the 4 edges to search **non-closed** islands and mark the region as invalid during traversal.
* Then we traversal the graph again to find `0`, that would be closed islands.

    private val invalid = 2
    private val directions = arrayOf(
        -1 to 0, 1 to 0, 0 to -1, 0 to 1)
    
    fun closedIsland(grid: Array<IntArray>): Int {
        val m = grid.size
        val n = grid[0].size
        
        for (row in 0 until m) {
            dfs(grid, row, 0)
            dfs(grid, row, n - 1)
        }
        
        for (col in 0 until n) {
            dfs(grid, 0, col)
            dfs(grid, m - 1, col)
        }
        
        var count = 0
        for (row in 0 until m) {
            for (col in 0 until n) {
                if (grid[row][col] == 0) {
                    dfs(grid, row, col)
                    count++
                }
            }
        }
        return count
    }
    
    private fun dfs(grid: Array<IntArray>, x: Int, y: Int) {
        if (x in 0 until grid.size &&
                y in 0 until grid[0].size &&
                grid[x][y] == 0) {
            grid[x][y] = invalid
            
            directions.forEach {
                dfs(grid, x + it.first, y + it.second)
            }
        }
    }
