## Traversal From Islands
We can traverse all the islands, and check if current island is closed. We can use DFS or BFS to traverse the grid.

```kotlin
class Solution {
    private val directions = arrayOf(
        intArrayOf(-1, 0),
        intArrayOf(1, 0),
        intArrayOf(0, -1),
        intArrayOf(0, 1)
    )

    private val visited = 2
    fun closedIsland(grid: Array<IntArray>): Int {
        val m = grid.size
        val n = grid[0].size
        var count = 0
        for (i in 0 until m) {
            for (j in 0 until n) {
                if (grid[i][j] == 0) {
                    if (dfs(grid, i, j)) count++
                }
            }
        }
        return count
    }

    private fun dfs(grid: Array<IntArray>, x: Int, y: Int): Boolean {
        val m = grid.size
        val n = grid[0].size
        if (x !in 0 until m || y !in 0 until n) return false
        if (grid[x][y] == 1) return true
        if (grid[x][y] == visited) return true

        grid[x][y] = visited

        var result = true
        directions.forEach { d ->
            // result = result & dfs(grid, x + d[0], y + d[1]) will not work, we have to traverse all the cells and then return the result.
            // but we can use `&&` to short-circuit the evaluation, it won't traverse all the cells of the same island.
            result = dfs(grid, x + d[0], y + d[1]) && result
        }
        return result
    }

    private fun bfs(grid: Array<IntArray>, i: Int, j: Int): Boolean {
        val m = grid.size
        val n = grid[0].size
        val q = ArrayDeque<Pair<Int, Int>>()
        q.addLast(i to j)
        var closed = true
        while (q.isNotEmpty()) {
            val pair = q.removeFirst()
            val x = pair.first
            val y = pair.second

            if (x !in 0 until m || y!in 0 until n) {
                closed = false
                continue
            }
            if (grid[x][y] != 0) continue
            grid[x][y] = visited
            directions.forEach { d ->
                q.addLast(x + d[0] to y + d[1])
            }
        }
        return closed
    }
}
```

## Traversal From Boundary
To find the closed island, we can find non-closed islands first, then find the closed islands. How can we find the non-closed islands? We can start searching from the edges of the grid, the islands which are connected to the edges are non-closed islands. We can mark them as invalid during traversal. Then we can find the closed islands by traversing the grid again.

* We traversal (either DFS or BFS) from the 4 edges to search **non-closed** islands and mark the region as invalid during traversal.
* Then we traversal the graph again to find `0`, that would be closed islands.

```kotlin
class Solution {
    private val invalid = 2
    private val directions = arrayOf(
        -1 to 0, 1 to 0, 0 to -1, 0 to 1)
    
    fun closedIsland(grid: Array<IntArray>): Int {
        val m = grid.size
        val n = grid[0].size
        
        for (row in 0 until m) {
            dfs(grid, row, 0)
            dfs(grid, row, n - 1)
        }
        
        for (col in 0 until n) {
            dfs(grid, 0, col)
            dfs(grid, m - 1, col)
        }
        
        var count = 0
        for (row in 0 until m) {
            for (col in 0 until n) {
                if (grid[row][col] == 0) {
                    dfs(grid, row, col)
                    count++
                }
            }
        }
        return count
    }
    
    private fun dfs(grid: Array<IntArray>, x: Int, y: Int) {
        if (x in 0 until grid.size &&
                y in 0 until grid[0].size &&
                grid[x][y] == 0) {
            grid[x][y] = invalid
            
            directions.forEach {
                dfs(grid, x + it.first, y + it.second)
            }
        }
    }
}
```
