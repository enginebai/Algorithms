# [1319. Number of Operations to Make Network Connected](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-operations-to-make-network-connected/description/)

## Traversal
We can count the number of connected components in the graph (for single node which will also one component itself), then return the number of components minus 1.

> We don't care about the redundant edges, or how to remove them, or how to connect the components, we just need to know the number of components.

```js
[Group 1] [Group 2] [Group 3] [Group 4]
 a b c       i j       x         y
         +1        +2        +3

[Group 1] [Group 2] [Group 3] 
 a b c d    x y z      i j    
         +1        +2        
```

How can we check if it's impossible to connect? For `n` nodes, we need at least `n - 1` edges to connect all nodes. So if the number of edges is less than `n - 1`, we can't connect all nodes.

```kotlin
fun makeConnected(n: Int, connections: Array<IntArray>): Int {
    if (connections.size < n - 1) return -1
    val adjSet = buildGraph(n, connections)
    val visited = BooleanArray(n)
    var componentsCount = 0
    for (i in 0 until n) {
        if (visited[i].not()) {
            dfs(adjSet, i, visited)
            componentsCount++
        }
    }
    return componentsCount - 1
}

private fun dfs(graph: Array<HashSet<Int>>, current: Int, visited: BooleanArray) {
    if (visited[current]) return
    visited[current] = true
    graph[current].forEach { adj ->
        dfs(graph, adj, visited)
    }
}

private fun buildGraph(n: Int, connections: Array<IntArray>): Array<HashSet<Int>> {
    val adjSet = Array<HashSet<Int>>(n) { HashSet<Int>() }
    for (c in connections) {
        val a = c[0]
        val b = c[1]
        adjSet[a].add(b)
        adjSet[b].add(a)
    } 
    return adjSet
}
```
