### DFS
The problem is equivalent to detect a cycle in a directed graph. If there exists a cycle, then we can't find the topological sort.

```kotlin
enum class State { NOT_VISIT, VISITED, FINISHED }

class Solution {

    fun canFinish(numCourses: Int, prerequisites: Array<IntArray>): Boolean {
        val graph = Array<HashSet<Int>>(numCourses) { hashSetOf<Int>() }
        for (p in prerequisites) {
            graph[p[1]].add(p[0])
        }

        val visited = Array<State>(numCourses) { State.NOT_VISIT }
        for (i in 0 until numCourses) {
            if (!dfs(graph, i, visited)) return false
        }
        return true
    }

    private fun dfs(graph: Array<HashSet<Int>>, i: Int, visited: Array<State>): Boolean {
        if (visited[i] == State.VISITED) return false
        if (visited[i] == State.FINISHED) return true

        visited[i] = State.VISITED
        graph[i].forEach { adj ->
            if (!dfs(graph, adj, visited)) return false
        }
        visited[i] = State.FINISHED
        return true
    }
}
```

* **Time Complexity**: `O(m + n)`, `m` is the number of courses, `n` is the number of prerequisites.
* **Space Complexity**: `O(m + n)`, we build a adjacent list that takes `O(m + n)`, and enqueue all courses that takes `O(n)`.

### BSF
BFS approach uses the indegrees of every vertex, for a course (vertex), the indegrees represents how many prerequisites we have to take before so that we can finish the current one.

For example, the `prerequisites` is `[[2, 0], [2, 1]]`, that means that I have to finish course `0` and `1` so that I can finish `2`, that can be represented in graph like this:

```js
0 -> 2
1 -> 2
```

So course (vertex) `2` has 2 indegree edges, and the number of indegrees is `2`.

To solve this problem, we build a graph with indegree array for every courses (vertices), and enqueue course if I finish all its prerequisites, and count how many courses did I finished.

```kotlin
fun canFinish(numCourses: Int, prerequisites: Array<IntArray>): Boolean {

    private fun byBFS(numCourses: Int, prerequisites: Array<IntArray>): Boolean {
        val inDegrees = IntArray(numCourses)
        val graph = Array<HashSet<Int>>(numCourses) { hashSetOf<Int>() }
        for (p in prerequisites) {
            graph[p[1]].add(p[0])
            inDegrees[p[0]]++
        }
        
        val queue = ArrayDeque<Int>()
        for (i in 0 until numCourses) {
            // Queue enques all the course that we can study now. (no or finished all prerequisites)
            if (inDegrees[i] == 0) {
                queue.addLast(i)
            }
        }
        val visited = BooleanArray(numCourses)
        while (queue.isNotEmpty()) {
            val course = queue.removeFirst()
            if (visited[course]) continue
            visited[course] = true
            // Find all courses after the current course
            graph[course].forEach { adj -> 
                inDegrees[adj]--
                // If all prerequiistes are finished, then I can study this after course.
                if (inDegrees[adj] == 0) queue.addLast(adj)
            }
        }
        for (i in 0 until numCourses) {
            if (!visited[i]) return false
        }
        return true
    }
```

* **Time Complexity**: As same as DFS.
* **Space Complexity**: As same as DFS.

### Clarification Questions
1. Are all the prerequisites pair unique?
2. What if `prerequisites` is empty? (but `numCourses` is 1 or greater than 1)
3. Do all the prerequisite pairs cover all courses from 0 to `numCourses - 1`.
