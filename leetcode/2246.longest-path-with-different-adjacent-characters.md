# [2246. Longest Path With Different Adjacent Characters](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-path-with-different-adjacent-characters/)

## DFS
It's similar to [687. Longest Univalue Path](../leetcode/687.longest-univalue-path.md), we define the `dfs(i)` function that returns the longest path (the number of nodes, not edges) starting at the node i (with the character of current root). Then we use function to traverse each node to find the longest path that passes the node. (Not necessarily pass the root)

For each node (as root), we traverse the children first (postorder), we can get a longer path from children if the character is different from root, otherwise, the length of the path is 0. After calculating the path of each child, we need to find the two largest paths in the array `childNodes` in linear time and update the global longest path, return the longer path of the root.

Before the traversal, we have to build the tree from `parent` array:
```js
index  =  0  1  2  3  4  5
parent = -1  0  0  1  1  2

// Conver to tree
0: [1, 2]
1: [3, 4]
2: [5]
```

```kotlin
class Solution {
    private var longestNode = 0

    fun longestPath(parent: IntArray, s: String): Int {
        val n = parent.size
        val children = Array<MutableList<Int>>(n) { mutableListOf<Int>() }
        for (i in 1 until n) {
            children[parent[i]].add(i)
        }
        dfs(0, s, children)
        return longestNode
    }

    private fun dfs(root: Int, s: String, children: Array<MutableList<Int>>): Int {
        val childNodes = IntArray(children[root].size)
        for (i in 0 until children[root].size) {
            // We have to traverse each children first, not check the character of the root
            // Because the longest path may not pass the root
            val nodeNumbers = dfs(children[root][i], s, children)
            childNodes[i] = if (s[root] != s[children[root][i]]) {
                nodeNumbers
            } else {
                0
            }
        }
        // The first and second largest number in the array
        var first = 0
        var second = 0
        for (i in 0 until children[root].size) {
            if (childNodes[i] >= first) {
                second = first
                first = childNodes[i]
            } else if (childNodes[i] > second) {
                second = childNodes[i]
            }
        }
        // The longest path that passes the root, +1 for the root
        longestNode = maxOf(longestNode, first + second + 1) 
        return first + 1 // The longest path starting from the root
    }
}
