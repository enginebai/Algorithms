# [2246. Longest Path With Different Adjacent Characters](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-path-with-different-adjacent-characters/)

## DFS
It's similar to [687. Longest Univalue Path](../leetcode/687.longest-univalue-path.md), we define the `dfs(i)` function that returns the longest path (the number of nodes, not edges) starting at the node `i` (with the character of current root). Then we use function to traverse each node to find the longest path that passes the node. (Not necessarily pass the root)

For each node (as root), we traverse the children first (postorder), we can get a longer path from children if the character is different from root, otherwise, the length of the path is `0`. 

```js
           root
   /    *|      |    *\ 
child1 child2 child3 child4

dfs(root) 
    for child: dfs(child) + 1
    ans = child2 + child4
    return max(child) + 1
```


After calculating the path of each child, we need to find the two largest paths in the array `childNodes` in linear time and update the global longest path, return the longer path of the root.

Before the traversal, we have to build the tree from `parent` array:
```js
index  =  0  1  2  3  4  5
parent = -1  0  0  1  1  2

// Conver to tree
0: [1, 2]
1: [3, 4]
2: [5]
```

```kotlin
private var longestNode = 0

fun longestPath(parent: IntArray, s: String): Int {
    val n = parent.size
    // We convert the parent array into adjacency list
    val children = Array<MutableList<Int>>(n) { mutableListOf<Int>() }
    for (i in 1 until n) {
        children[parent[i]].add(i)
    }
    dfs(0, s, children)
    return longestNode
}

private fun dfs(root: Int, s: String, children: Array<MutableList<Int>>): Int {
    // The first and second largest number in the array
    var first = 0
    var second = 0
    for (i in 0 until children[root].size) {
        // We have to traverse each children first, not check the character of the root
        // Because the longest path may not pass the root
        val nodeNumbers = dfs(children[root][i], s, children) 
        // Then decide if we can add the child to the path if the character is different
        val finalValue = if (s[root] != s[children[root][i]]) child else 0

        // Find the first and second largest number in linear time.
        if (finalValue >= first) {
            second = first
            first = finalValue
        } else if (finalValue > second) {
            second = finalValue
        }
    }
    // The longest path that passes the root, +1 for the root node
    //       +1
    //     /    \
    //  left   right 
    longestNode = maxOf(longestNode, first + second + 1) 
    return first + 1 // The longest path starting from the root, +1 for the root node
}
```
