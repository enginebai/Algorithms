## [80. Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array II](https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-duplicates-from-sorted-array-ii)

This is the variant of [26. Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array](../leetcode/26.remove-duplicates-from-sorted-array.md), the difference is that we can allow the duplicate number appear at most twice.

**Idea!!** Iterate every number (`read` pointer), check with previous number:
1. If it's duplicate, increment the count. And if `count <= 2`, then we write the number.
2. If it's not duplicate, reset the count to 1, and write the number.

```python
def removeDuplicates(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
    write = 1
    count = 1
    for read in range(1, len(nums)):
        if nums[read] != nums[write - 1]:
            count = 1
            nums[write] = nums[read]
            write += 1
        else:
            count += 1
            if count <= 2:
                nums[write] = nums[read]
                write += 1
    return write
```

```kotlin
fun removeDuplicates(nums: IntArray): Int {
    // write pointer is the index we're currently going to write
    var write = 1
    var count = 1
    for (read in 1 until nums.size) {
        if (nums[write - 1] != nums[read]) {
            count = 1
            nums[write++] = nums[read]
        } else {
            count++
            if (count <= 2) {
                nums[write++] = nums[read]
            }
        }
    }
    return write
}
```

* **Time Complexity**: `O(n)`.
* **Space Complexity**: `O(1)`.

Or we don't count and generalize the solution to allow the duplicate number appear at most `k` times. How can we check if the count of current number is greater than `k` times? We can use index `write - k` to check. Why?

**We can write the duplicate at most `k` time, so we check the previous `k` numbers (`nums[write - k]`) to see if we have written the current number `k` timew.**

> The `write` pointer is the next position to write.

```js
k = 4
..., X, X, X, X, Y
     |--------|  ^
          4      write
```

 
Suppose we've written `k - 1` duplicate numbers, then `nums[write - k]` should not be equal to the current number. If we've written `k` duplicate numbers, then `nums[write - k]` should be the current number.

```js
// k = 4
..., X, Y, Y, Y, _
        |--3--|  
     ^           ^
     write-k     write 

// If `nums[write]` is `Y` that is not equal to `nums[write - k]`, then we can write `Y` to `write` position.

..., X, Y, Y, Y, Y, _
        |---4----|  
        ^           ^
        write-k     write 
```
If `nums[write]` is `Y` that is equal to `nums[write - k]`, then we CANNOT write `Y` to `write` position.

```python
def removeDuplicates(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
    k = 2
    write = k
    for read in range(k, len(nums)):
        if nums[read] != nums[write - k]:
            nums[write] = nums[read]
            write += 1
    return write
```

```kotlin
fun removeDuplicates(nums: IntArray): Int {
    val k = 2
    // For the first k numbers, we can always write them.
    // So we start from the (k + 1)-th number.
    var write = k
    for (read in k until nums.size) {
        // Or we can use `read - 1` to get the previous item as well
        if (nums[write - k] != nums[read]) {
            nums[write++] = nums[read]
        }
    }
    return write
}
```
