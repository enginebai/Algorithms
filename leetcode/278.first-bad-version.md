## [278. First Bad Version](https://leetcode.com/problems/first-bad-version/)

The problem can be model as binary search for the first `X` from `[O, O, X, X, X]`. 
The idea is as same as "finding the first index of target" ([34. Find First and Last Position of Element in Sorted Array](../leetcode/34.find-first-and-last-position-of-element-in-sorted-array.md)) or "finding the smallest number which is equals to or greater than `target`" ([35. Search Insert Position](../leetcode/35.search-insert-position.md)).
