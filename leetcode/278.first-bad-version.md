# [278. First Bad Version](https://leetcode.com/problems/first-bad-version/)

The problem can be model as binary search for the first `X` from `[O, O, X, X, X]`. 
The idea is as same as "finding the first index of target" ([34. Find First and Last Position of Element in Sorted Array](../leetcode/34.find-first-and-last-position-of-element-in-sorted-array.md)) or "finding the smallest number which is equals to or greater than `target`" ([35. Search Insert Position](../leetcode/35.search-insert-position.md)).

```kotlin
/* The isBadVersion API is defined in the parent class VersionControl.
      fun isBadVersion(version: Int) : Boolean {} */

class Solution: VersionControl() {
    override fun firstBadVersion(n: Int) : Int {
        var left = 1
        var right = n
        while (left <= right) {
            val middle = left + (right - left) / 2
            if (isBadVersion(middle)) {
                right = middle - 1
            } else {
                left = middle + 1
            }
        }
        return left
	}
}
