## [442. Find All Duplicates in an Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-all-duplicates-in-an-array)

### Hash Table
We're going to use the input array itself as hash table, and use index as key:
1. Iterate the array
2. Mark the number as negative as we walk through.
3. If the number is negative, then we've seen before, and add to our answer.

> The problem is different from [287. Find the Duplicate Number](../leetcode/287.find-the-duplicate-number.md), the current problem might contain more than one duplicate, but the problem 287 only contains one duplicate, binary search is not applicable here because it only works for monotonicity.

```kotlin
fun findDuplicates(nums: IntArray): List<Int> {
    val results = mutableListOf<Int>()
    for (i in 0 until nums.size) {
        val index = abs(nums[i]) - 1
        if (nums[index] > 0) {
            nums[index] = -nums[index]
        } else {
            results.add(index + 1)
        }
    }
    return results
}
```

* **Time Complexity**: `O(n)`.
* **Space Complexity**: `O(1)`.

### Cyclic Sorting
Since the input ranges `1..n`, we can apply cyclic sorting that is similar to [448. Find All Numbers Disappeared in an Array](../leetcode/448.find-all-numbers-disappeared-in-an-array.md), for example, `nums[i] = 4`, then we should put to index `3`. Then iterate again to find the duplicate number that `nums[i] != i + 1`.

Here we have to be careful about the index, since the input array is range from `1..n`, we have to minus one to get the index.

```kotlin
fun findDuplicates(nums: IntArray): List<Int> {
    val results = mutableListOf<Int>()
    var i = 0 
    while (i < nums.size) {
        if (nums[nums[i] - 1] != nums[i]) {
            nums.swap(i, nums[i] - 1)
        } else {
            i++
        }
    }

    for (i in 0 until nums.size) {
        if (nums[i] != i + 1) results.add(nums[i])
    }
    return results
}

// Skip the swap function.
```
