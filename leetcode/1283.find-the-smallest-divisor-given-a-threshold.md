# [1283. Find the Smallest Divisor Given a Threshold](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-smallest-divisor-given-a-threshold/)

## Hints
- What happens to the sum if you increase the divisor? Try a few examples.
- Can you check if a given divisor is feasible in `O(n)`?

## Key Insights
The core intuition is to recognize that as the divisor increases, the sum of all `ceil(num / divisor)` strictly decreases. This is because dividing by a larger number always produces a smaller (or equal) result for each element, and rounding up preserves this monotonicity. This monotonic relationship is the key to applying binary search.

How do we observe this?
- Try a few divisors by hand from linear search: for small divisors, the sum is large; for large divisors, the sum is small.
- For example, with `nums = [1,2,5,9]` and `threshold = 6`,
    - divisor = 1: sum = 17
    - divisor = 4: sum = 7
    - divisor = 5: sum = 5
    - As divisor increases, sum decreases.

How do we analyze the feasibility?
- For any fixed divisor, we can check in `O(n)` if the sum of all `ceil(num / divisor)` is `<= threshold`.
- If a divisor is feasible (sum <= threshold), then any larger divisor will also be feasible (sum will be even smaller).
- If a divisor is not feasible, any smaller divisor will also not be feasible (sum will be even larger).

**Summary:**
- When you see a problem where increasing a parameter makes a condition easier/harder in a predictable way, and you can check feasibility efficiently, consider binary search on that parameter.
- Here, the divisor is the parameter, and the sum is monotonic with respect to it, so binary search is the optimal approach.

## Binary Search
Use binary search to find the smallest divisor such that the sum of all `ceil(num / divisor)` is `<= threshold`.

- Monotonicity: `divisor` is greater, `sum` is less <= `threshold`, more feasible.
- Lower bound: `1`, smallest possible divisor.
- Upper bound: `max(nums)`, the number can divide all numbers into `1` (the sum is the sum of all numbers).
- Feasibility: For a given divisor, is the sum of all `ceil(num / divisor)` <= `threshold`?

> For the check, you can use integer math: `ceil(num / divisor)` is equivalent to `(num + divisor - 1) / divisor`.

```kotlin
fun smallestDivisor(nums: IntArray, threshold: Int): Int {
    var left = 1
    var right = nums.max()
    while (left <= right) {
        val middle = left + (right - left) / 2
        val feasible = check(nums, threshold, middle)
        if (feasible) {
            right = middle - 1
        } else {
            left = middle + 1
        }
    }
    return left
}

private fun check(nums: IntArray, threshold: Int, divisor: Int): Boolean {
    var sum = 0
    for (num in nums) {
        sum += ceil(num * 1f / divisor * 1f).toInt()
    }
    return sum <= threshold
}
```

- **Time Complexity**: `O(n * log m)`, where `n` is the length of `nums`, `m` is the maximum value in `nums`.
- **Space Complexity**: `O(1)`.

## Edge Cases & Pitfalls
- `nums` contains only one element: The answer is `ceil(nums[0] / threshold)`.
- `threshold` is equal to `nums.size`: The answer is `max(nums)`.
- All elements in `nums` are the same: The answer is `ceil(nums[0] * nums.size / threshold)`.
- **Large values**: Make sure to avoid integer overflow in the sum calculation.

## Pitfalls
- Forgetting to use integer math for `ceil(num / divisor)`, which can lead to floating-point errors or inefficiency.
