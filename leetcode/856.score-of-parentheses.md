## Stack
Suppose we have the string: s = `(()(()))`, we can use stack to solve this problem:
1. For `(`, we just push it into stack.
2. For `)`, we pop until we encounter `(`, then we calculate the score of `()` and push it back to stack.

```md
s           action          stack
(:          push `(`,       `[(]`       
(:          push `(`,       `[(]`   
(:          push `(`,       `[(]`
((:         push `(`,       `[(, (]`
(():        pop until `(`,  `[(, 1]`
> it forms `()` which has score 1, then we push 1.
(()(:       push `(`,       `[(, 1, (]`
(()((:      push `(`,       `[(, 1, (, (]`
(()(():     pop until `(`,  `[(, 1, (, 1]`
> it forms `()`, which has score 1, then we push 1.
(()(()):    pop until `(`,  `[(, 1, 2]`
> it forms `(1)`, which is `(A)` pattern that has score `2 * A`, so `2 * 1` and push into stack.
(()(())):   pop until `(`,  `[6]`
> it forms `(1, 2)`, which is `(A, B)` pattern that has score `A + B = C` and then pattern `(C)`, so `2 * 3`
```

```kotlin
fun scoreOfParentheses(s: String): Int {
    val stack = Stack<String>()
    for (c in s) {
        // For `(`, we just push it into stack.
        if (c == '(') {
            stack.push(c.toString())
        } else {
            // For `)`, we pop until we encounter `(`, then we calculate the score of `()` and push it back to stack.
            if (stack.peek() == "(") { // For the case "()" in stack
                // Pop the left '('
                stack.pop()
                // Form "()" which has score 1.
                stack.push(1.toString())
            } else {
                // For the case "(A,B,C)" in stack
                var num = 0
                while (stack.isNotEmpty() && stack.peek() != "(") {
                    num += stack.pop().toInt()
                }
                // Pop the left '('
                stack.pop()
                // Form "(A,B,C)" which has score 2 * (A + B + C).
                num *= 2
                stack.push(num.toString())
            }
        }
    }
    // Sum up all scores in stack.
    var result = 0
    while (stack.isNotEmpty()) {
        result += stack.pop().toInt()
    }
    return result
}
```

* **Time Complexity**: `O(n)` to iterate all characters in string.
* **Space Complexity**: `O(n)` for stack.

> I don't understand the following solution, but it works.
```kotlin
fun scoreOfParentheses(s: String): Int {
    val stack = Stack<Int>()
    var num = 0
    for (c in s) {
        if (c == '(') {
            stack.push(num)
            num = 0
        } else {
            num = stack.pop() + maxOf(1, num * 2)
        }
    }
    return num
}
```
