# [1530. Number of Good Leaf Nodes Pairs](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-good-leaf-nodes-pairs/description/)

## Postorder
We have to keep track of the number of leaf nodes with a particular distance for each root node.

> TODO: Add explanation and Kotlin code.

```python
class Solution:
    def countPairs(self, root: TreeNode, distance: int) -> int:
        self.result = 0
        
        # Helper function to perform DFS
        def dfs(node):
            # If it's a null node, return an empty list (no leaves)
            if not node:
                return [0] * (distance + 1)
            
            # If it's a leaf node, return distance 1 (leaf nodes are distance 1 from themselves)
            if not node.left and not node.right:
                leaf_distances = [0] * (distance + 1)
                leaf_distances[1] = 1  # Leaf is at distance 1
                return leaf_distances
            
            # Perform DFS on left and right children
            left_distances = dfs(node.left)
            right_distances = dfs(node.right)
            
            # Count good pairs (pairs whose distance is <= given distance)
            for l_dist in range(1, distance + 1):
                for r_dist in range(1, distance + 1):
                    if l_dist + r_dist <= distance:
                        self.result += left_distances[l_dist] * right_distances[r_dist]
            
            # Prepare the distance array for the current node
            current_distances = [0] * (distance + 1)
            for i in range(1, distance):
                current_distances[i + 1] = left_distances[i] + right_distances[i]
            
            return current_distances
        
        # Start DFS from root
        dfs(root)
        return self.result
