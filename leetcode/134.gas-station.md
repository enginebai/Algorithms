## [134. Gas Station](https://leetcode.com/problems/gas-station/description/)

### Greedy
1. If the sum of gas is more thant the sum of cost, then there must be a solution.
2. The tank should never be negative, so restart whenever there is a negative number of tank.

```kotlin
fun canCompleteCircuit(gas: IntArray, cost: IntArray): Int {
    val n = gas.size
    var sumGas = 0
    var sumCost = 0
    var tank = 0
    var startIndex = 0
    for (i in 0 until n) {
        sumGas += gas[i]
        sumCost += cost[i]

        tank += gas[i] - cost[i]
        if (tank < 0) {
            startIndex = i + 1
            tank = 0
        }
    }
    
    return if (sumGas >= sumCost) startIndex
    else -1
}
