# [871. Minimum Number of Refueling Stops](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-number-of-refueling-stops/)

## Heap + Greedy
We want to refuel as few times as possible -> Greedy, the best greedy strategy is to always refuel at the station with **the most fuel when we're stuck**.

> - 找最低加油次數，那就能不加油就不加，什麼時候要加油？就是不得不加的時候，現在不加就到不了下一個目的地。(貪心) 而且一定是先選最大油量的去加，一直加直到可以到達下一站或終點。
> - 事后诸葛亮体现在我们是我們到達加油站的時候都先不加，等到没油了才去想应该在之前的某个站加油。这个事后诸葛亮本质上解决的是，基于当前信息无法获取最优解，我们必须掌握全部信息之后回溯。 [(Source)](https://leetcode-solution-leetcode-pp.gitbook.io/leetcode-solution/thinkings/heap-2)
> - [My original thought](#my-original-thought) is to refuel whenever we can, then review all the previous refueling stations, and see if we can skip some of them. But the correct way is to skip as much as possible, and only refuel when we're stuck.

```kotlin
fun minRefuelStops(target: Int, startFuel: Int, stations: Array<IntArray>): Int {
    val maxHeap = PriorityQueue<Int>(reverseOrder())
    var fuel = startFuel
    var ans = 0
    var i = 0
    while (fuel < target) {
        while (i < stations.size && stations[i][0] <= fuel) {
            maxHeap.add(stations[i][1])
            i++
        }

        if (maxHeap.isEmpty()) return -1
        fuel += maxHeap.poll()
        ans++
    }
    return ans
}

// Or equivalent
fun minRefuelStops(target: Int, startFuel: Int, stations: Array<IntArray>): Int {
    val maxHeap = PriorityQueue<Int>(reverseOrder())
    var last = 0
    var remainingFuel = startFuel
    var ans = 0
    for ((i, fuel) in stations) {
        remainingFuel -= (i - last)

        while (remainingFuel < 0 && maxHeap.isNotEmpty()) {
            remainingFuel += maxHeap.poll()
            ans++
        }
        if (remainingFuel < 0) return -1

        maxHeap.add(fuel)
        last = i
    }

    // Check the final leg to target
    remainingFuel -= (target - last)
    while (remainingFuel < 0 && maxHeap.isNotEmpty()) {
        remainingFuel += maxHeap.poll()
        ans++
    }
    if (remainingFuel < 0) return -1

    return ans
}
```

## My Original Thought
Key idea: Refuel greedily, recheck which previous refueling is unnecessary. 假設現在油足夠，可以超過下一個加油站，但是我們一樣先加油，因為不知道後面有沒有足夠加油站和油量。

### Breakdown
1. How to simulate the process of driving regardless of the number of refuel?
2. How to detect unreachable destination?
3. How to check if previous refuel is necessary: Not at target, and no station anymore or can't reach station

### Steps
position `i` → gas `j`: consume `j - i` fuel, refuel `gas[j]`, count++, check if we can remove any previous refuel.
1. Maintain current position, fuel (maximum reachable position), gas index.
2. Keep moving until current position + fuel ≥ destination.
3. Otherwise, use fuel to get to gas to refuel: 
    - Refuel
    - Check any previous refuel is necessary

```kotlin
val position: `i`
val fuel: `x`
val station: `j`

while (i + x < target && has station) {
    i = i + x // move to next station
    x = 0
    // refuel
    while (j < len(s) && s[j] < i) {
        x += s[j]
        j++
    }
}

fun hasStation() = j < len(s) && i + x >= s[j]
```
