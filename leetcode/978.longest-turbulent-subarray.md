# [978. Longest Turbulent Subarray](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-turbulent-subarray/)

## Hints
- Try to use two pointers or a sliding window to track the current turbulent subarray: `start..end`.
- What is the condition for a subarray to be turbulent? How do you check if the pattern is broken?

## Sliding Window / Two Pointers
A subarray is turbulent if the comparison sign between every adjacent pair alternates (i.e., `> < > <` or `< > < >`). 

The key idea is to iterate through the array, and for each position, check if the current and previous comparisons alternate. If not (either equal or the sign doesn't flip), reset the window.

```kotlin
// Follow the template of "group by consecutive"
fun maxTurbulenceSize(arr: IntArray): Int {
    var ans = 1
    var i = 1
    while (i < arr.size) {
        // We skip the equal case, because it's not turbulent
        if (arr[i - 1] == arr[i]) {
            i++
            continue
        }
        val start = i - 1
        var isIncreasing = arr[i - 1] < arr[i]
        var isDecreasing = arr[i - 1] > arr[i]
        // Move to the next position
        i++
        while (i < arr.size) {
            if (isIncreasing && arr[i - 1] > arr[i]) {
                isIncreasing = false
                isDecreasing = true
            } else if (isDecreasing && arr[i - 1] < arr[i]) {
                isIncreasing = true
                isDecreasing = false
            } else {
                break
            }
            i++
        }
        // After the loop, i will be the next position of current group.
        ans = maxOf(ans, i - start)
    }
    return ans
}

// Or equivalent, it's more popular from the discussions
/**
 * This solution uses dynamic programming to track the length of turbulent subarrays.
 * 
 * For each position i, we maintain two counters:
 * - inc: length of turbulent subarray ending at i where arr[i-1] < arr[i]
 * - dec: length of turbulent subarray ending at i where arr[i-1] > arr[i]
 * 
 * When we see arr[i-1] < arr[i]:
 * - The current increasing pair can extend the previous decreasing sequence
 * - So inc = dec + 1
 * - And dec must reset to 1 since we can't extend a decreasing sequence
 * 
 * When we see arr[i-1] > arr[i]:
 * - The current decreasing pair can extend the previous increasing sequence
 * - So dec = inc + 1
 * - And inc must reset to 1 since we can't extend an increasing sequence
 * 
 * When arr[i-1] == arr[i]:
 * - Both sequences must reset to 1 since equal elements break turbulence

- **Time Complexity**: `O(N)` where `N` is the length of `arr`.
- **Space Complexity**: `O(1)`.

## Edge Cases
- All elements are equal: answer is 1.
- Array of length 1: answer is 1.
- No turbulence (strictly increasing or decreasing): answer is 2.
- Multiple equal elements in a row: must reset the window.

## Pitfalls
- **Forgetting to skip the equal case.**
