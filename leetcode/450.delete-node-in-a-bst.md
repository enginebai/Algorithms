## [450. Delete Node in a BST](https://leetcode.com/problems/delete-node-in-a-bst/)

### My Solution
* We don't have `parent` pointer, so we have to update parent node as we search or swap with the node.
* The node to delete is root or not will affect the result. + how many child does the node to delete have will affect the algorithm as well (just like mentioned in [note](../topics/tree.md#binary-search-tree)), all the combinations will be:
    1. The node is root, is leaf. (becomes empty tree)
    1. The node is root, has only one child. (update the root)
    1. The node is root, has two children. (like note)
    1. The node is NOT root, is leaf. (like note)
    1. The node is NOT root, has only one child. (like note)
    1. The node is NOT root, has two children. (like note)
* The `successor(node)` is a little from orignal binary tree's, we keep moving down the node to delete until it becomes the leaf, so we don't **look up** (we don't find the lowest ancestor)

```kotlin
/**
 * Example:
 * var ti = TreeNode(5)
 * var v = ti.`val`
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * class TreeNode(var `val`: Int) {
 *     var left: TreeNode? = null
 *     var right: TreeNode? = null
 * }
