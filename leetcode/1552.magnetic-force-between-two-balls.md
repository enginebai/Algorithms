# [1552. Magnetic Force Between Two Balls](https://leetcode.com/problems/magnetic-force-between-two-balls/description/)

```js
position        distances       min
1, 2, 3, 4, 7
A  B     C          1 | 2 =     1
A     B  C          2 | 2 =     1
A  B        C       1 | 5 =     1
A     B     C       2 | 4 =     2
A        B  C       3 | 3 =     3 <-- answer
```

## Linear Search
If we place the balls at least distance `d` between them, then `d` will be the minimum distance (force) between the balls. We can start from `1` to check if we can place all balls at least distance `1` (`distance >= 1` is acceptable), then try to increase the distance until we can't.

> We will use *distance* to represent the *force* between the balls in our explanation.

## Binary Search
Based on the linear search, we can optimize the search process.
* Search range: Given the two palls, the minimum distance between them is `1`, and the maximum distance is the distance between the leftmost and rightmost balls. So the search range is `[1, max distance]`.
* Monotonicity: If we can place the two balls with a minimum distance `d` (other distances might be larger than `d`, it's acceptable), then we can also place the balls with a distance `d2` where `d2 <= d`. If we can't place the balls with a distance `d`, then we can't place the balls with a distance `d2` where `d2 > d`. **As the distance increases, the number of balls we can place decreases. (we have to put `m` balls)**

```js
// m = 5
balls       9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 3, 2, 0
feasible    O, O, O, O, O, X, X, X
                        ^
                        Max distance
```

Based on the above characteristics, we can use binary search on value: given a distance, we can check if we can place the balls with the minimum distance between them. We find the last element that satisfies the condition.

```kotlin
fun maxDistance(position: IntArray, m: Int): Int {
    val n = position.size
    position.sort()

    var left = 1
    var right = position[n - 1] - position[0]
    while (left <= right) {
        val middle = left + (right - left) / 2
        if (canDistribute(position, m, middle)) {
            left = middle + 1
        } else {
            right = middle - 1
        }
    }
    return right
}

// Check if we can place all balls at least distance?
private fun canDistribute(position: IntArray, m: Int, minDistance: Int): Boolean {
    var balls = 1
    var previous = position[0]
    var i = 1
    while (i < position.size && balls < m) {
        val current = position[i]
        if (current - previous >= minDistance) {
            balls++
            previous = current
        }
        i++
    }
    return balls == m
}
```
