## [485. Max Consecutive Ones](https://leetcode.com/problems/max-consecutive-ones/)

## Solutions
### Straight-Forward
We count the `1` and reset the counter as `0` occurs. And we have to compare with the max count for each iteration.

```kotlin
fun findMaxConsecutiveOnes(nums: IntArray): Int {
    var maxCount = 0
    var currentCount = 0
    for (i in 0 until nums.size) {
        currentCount = if (nums[i] == 1) currentCount + 1 else 0
        maxCount = max(maxCount, currentCount)
    }
    return maxCount
}
```

### X * 0 = 0
It's a binary array, that means the element is either `0` or `1`:
* Every number times zero is zero.
* Every number times one is itself.

```kotlin
fun findMaxConsecutiveOnes(nums: IntArray): Int {
    var maxCount = 0
    var currentCount = 0
    nums.forEach { i ->
        currentCount = (currentCount + i) * i
        maxCount = max(macCount, currentCount)
    }
    return maxCount
}
```

### Complexity
* **Time Complexity**: `O(n)` for only one for-loop.
* **Space Complexity**: `O(1)` for two counters.
