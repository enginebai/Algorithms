## Binary Search

> NOTE: The problem is looking for the square root of x **rounded down to the nearest integer**. If you are checking if a number is a perfect square, please check [633. Sum of Square Numbers](../leetcode/633.sum-of-square-numbers.md) or [367. Valid Perfect Square](../leetcode/367.valid-perfect-square.md).

The `sqrt` is always in the range of `1..x`, so we can apply the binary search to find the `sqrt` number, that is searching `sqrt * sqrt = x`, if `x` is a perfect square, then we find the `sqrt` number, otherwise, we find the largest number `num` which `num * num <= x` because we have to round down to the nearest integer.

```js
x = 4
sqrt = 2

x = 8
sqrt = 2.8... round down to 2

1 * 1 = 1 <= 8  [O]
2 * 2 = 4 <= 8  [O] * answer
3 * 3 = 9  > 8  [X]
4 * 4 = 16 > 8  [X]
```

We can generalize the problem is to **find the last number `num` which `num * num <= x`** which `num` in `1..x`, then we can apply the binary search to find the `num`.
```js
x = 15, sqrt = 3.87... round down to 3

1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, ...
O, O, O, X, X, X...
      ^ // The largest number `num` which `num * num <= x`
```

> Note: We should check `sqrt = x / sqrt` (`num^2 <= target` is equivalent to `num <= target / num`) to prevent overflow of `sqrt * sqrt`.

```kotlin
fun mySqrt(x: Int): Int {
    if (x == 0) return 0
    var left = 1
    var right = x

    while (left <= right) {
        val middle = left + (right - left) / 2
        if (valid(middle, x)) {
            left = middle + 1
        } else {
            right = middle - 1
        }
    }   
    return right
}

private fun valid(middle: Int, x: Int): Boolean {
    // Original is `middle * middle <= x`
    // Equivalently, to prevent overflow:
    return middle <= x / middle
}
```

* **Time Complexity:** `O(log n)`.
* **Space Complexity:** `O(1)`.
