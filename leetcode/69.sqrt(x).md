## [69. Sqrt(x)](https://leetcode.com/problems/sqrtx)

The `sqrt` is always in the range of `1..x`, so we can apply the binary search to find the `sqrt` number, that is searching `sqrt * sqrt = x`, we can find `sqrt` by transforming the equation to `sqrt = x / sqrt` to search in case of overflow of `sqrt * sqrt`.

If we find the `sqrt * sqrt == x`, then we find the `sqrt` number, otherwise, we can find the `sqrt` number by finding the largest number `num` which `num * num <= x`. Le't take a look at the following examples:
* For `x = 4`, we can find the `sqrt` is `2`, and `2 * 2 = 4`.
* For `x = 8`, the square root of `8` is `2.8...`, so we return `2` as the `sqrt` number.

We can generalize the problem is to **find the largest number `num` which `num * num <= x`** which `num` in `1..x`, then we can apply the binary search to find the `num`.

```kotlin
fun mySqrt(x: Int): Int {
    // Special cases
    if (x <= 1) return x

    // We start from 1, not 0 in case of division by zero.
    var left = 1
    var right = x
    while (left <= right) {
        val middle = left + (right - left) / 2
        val sqrt = x / middle
        // Or we can return here as we found the sqrt.
        // if (sqrt == middle) return middle
        if (middle <= sqrt) {
            left = middle + 1
        } else {
            right = middle - 1
        }
    }    
    return right 
}
```

* **Time Complexity:** `O(lg n)`.
* **Space Complexity:** `O(1)`.

```js
x = 8
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8
L     M       R

   LM R
  R L  

x = 12
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12
