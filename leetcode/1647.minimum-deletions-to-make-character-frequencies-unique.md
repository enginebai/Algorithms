# [1647. Minimum Deletions to Make Character Frequencies Unique](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-deletions-to-make-character-frequencies-unique/description/)

## Greedy
To delete characters so that the frequency of each character is unique, we can start from the most frequent character to the least frequent character. For each character, we ensure the frequency is **at most the previous frequency - 1**. If the frequency is already unique (< previous frequency - 1), we can skip this character.

```js
3, 3, 2 // Frequency (sorted)
3, 2, 1 // After deleting to make the frequency unique

frequency: 6, 3, 3, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1
expected:  6, 3, 2, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0
deletions: 0  0  1  1  2  1  1  1
```

> NOTE: The 0 frequency character is ignored. So we can always delete the character until its frequency is 0.

We can count the frequency and sort it, then iterate from the most to least frequent character to delete. Here we use bucket sort since the frequency is at most the length of the string.
```kotlin
fun minDeletions(s: String): Int {
    val n = s.length
    val count = IntArray(26)
    for (c in s) {
        count[c - 'a']++
    }
    val bucket = Array<MutableList<Char>>(n + 1) { mutableListOf() }
    (0 until 26).forEach {
        val index = count[it]
        bucket[index].add('a' + it)
    }
    var expectedCount = -1
    var deletions = 0

    // Iterate from the most to least frequent character
    for (i in n downTo 1) {
        /**
        7: []
        6: [a]
        5: []
        4: []
        3: [b, c]
        2: [y, z]
        1: [d, e, f]

        frequency: 6, 3, 3, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1
        expected:  6, 3, 2, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0
        deletions; 0  0  1  1  2  1  1  1
        */
        if (bucket[i].isEmpty()) continue

        // Identify the first most frequency
        if (expectedCount == -1) {
            expectedCount = i
        }

        /**
        5, 5, 1, 1, 1
        5, 4, 1, 0, 0
              * // We can ignore if the frequency is already unique
            */
        if (expectedCount > i) expectedCount = i

        /**
         * Iterate all the character of the same frequency
         * 3: [a, b, c]
         * frequency: 3, 3, 3
         * expected:  3, 2, 1
         */
        val size = bucket[i].size
        for (c in 0 until size) {
            deletions += (i - expectedCount)

            // We don't decrease the expectedCount if it's already 0
            if (expectedCount > 0)
                expectedCount--
        }
    }

    return deletions
}
