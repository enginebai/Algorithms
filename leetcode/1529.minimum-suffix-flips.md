# [1529. Minimum Suffix Flips](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-suffix-flips/description/)

## Greedy
```js
1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0
            _, _
            j
_, _, _, _, _, _
i
```

If we flip at `i` first, it will affect the entire row. But if we flip at `j`, it affects the last two bits only.

We should flip to match the target from left to right, because flipping the left bit will affect the entire string. We match the left part first, then flip the right part to have the minimum numbers of operations. We don't have to care the right part when flipping the left part, because we will flip the right part later to match.

If we flip the right part to match first, then flip the left part, it will affect the right part again. We need to flip the right part after matching the left part, which leads more operations.

```js
s = 0, 0
target = 1, 1

// We flip the right first, then left, it will affect the right part again, we need to flip the right part again.
0, 0 -> 0, 1 -> 1, 0 -> 1, 1

// We slip the left first, then right, it will affect the right part only once.
0, 0 -> 1, 1
```

```kotlin
fun minFlips(target: String): Int {
    var flips = 0
    var current = '0'
    for (i in 0 until target.length) {
        if (target[i] != current) {
            flips++
            current = if (current == '1') '0' else '1'
        }
    }
    return flips
}
```
