# [826. Most Profit Assigning Work](https://leetcode.com/problems/most-profit-assigning-work/description/)

## Greedy + Binary Search
We can sort the jobs by difficulty, so we can find the last job which difficulty <= ability by binary search for each worker.

```js
difficulty = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6
             O  O  O  X  X  X
             ^^^^^^^ // The job we can assign to gain the maximum profit
                     
worker[i].ability = 3
```

For the job with `difficulty <= ability`, how can we find the maximum profit between the jobs within ability efficiently? We can precompute the maximum profit for each difficulty level, that is for jobs with difficulty up to `difficulty[i]`. For example, `precompute[3] = 7` means that the maximum profit for jobs with `difficulty <= 3` is `7`. **This creates a monotonic array of maximum profits.**

```js
index       = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
difficulty  = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6
profit      = 3, 1, 7, 2, 9, 4
precompute  = 3, 3, 7, 7, 9, 9
                       *

// If we select the job with difficulty 3, the maximum profit is 7, max(3, 1, 7, 2) = 7
```

With the sorted jobs and the precomputed maximum profits, we can find the maximum profit for the worker by binary searching the last job which `difficulty <= ability`, and find the maximum profit from the precomputed maximum profits during the binary search.

> - 排序加二分,从小到大排难度和收益,并对排序后的收益进行处理,使该处的收益是从位置0到该处的最大收益,就能避免难度大收益低的情况,最后枚举每个工人,再选择收益就行

```kotlin
data class Job(
    val difficulty: Int,
    val profit: Int
)

fun maxProfitAssignment(difficulty: IntArray, profit: IntArray, worker: IntArray): Int {
    val n = difficulty.size
    val jobs = Array<Job>(n) {
        Job(difficulty[it], profit[it])
    }
    jobs.sortBy { it.difficulty }

    // Precompute the max profit for jobs with difficulty up to difficulty[i]
    // Or we can just update the profit field for each job without creating a new array.
    val maxProfitAtDifficulty = IntArray(n)
    maxProfitAtDifficulty[0] = jobs.first().profit
    for (i in 1 until n) {
        maxProfitAtDifficulty[i] = maxOf(jobs[i].profit, maxProfitAtDifficulty[i - 1])
    }

    var totalProfit = 0
    for (ability in worker) {
        // Find the last job which difficulty <= ability
        // O O O X X X
        //     ^
        val lastJobIndex = searchJob(jobs, ability)
        if (lastJobIndex >= 0) {
            totalProfit += maxProfitAtDifficulty[lastJobIndex]
        }
    }
    return totalProfit
}

// Find the last position that jobs[i].difficulty <= ability
private fun searchJob(jobs: Array<Job>, ability: Int): Int {
    var left = 0
    var right = jobs.size - 1
    while (left <= right) {
        val middle = left + (right - left) / 2
        val canDo = jobs[middle].difficulty <= ability
        if (canDo) left = middle + 1
        else right = middle - 1
    }
    return right
}
```

* **Time Complexity:** `O(n * log n + m * log n)`, where `n` is the number of jobs, and `m` is the number of workers.
* **Space Complexity:** `O(n)`.

## Greedy + Two Pointers
We can sort the jobs by difficulty, and sort the workers by ability. Then match the job to the worker with the highest profit where the `difficulty <= ability` of the worker.

After sorting the jobs and workers, both arrays are monotonic, so we can iterate through the jobs and workers via two pointers to find the maximum profit job for each worker. One pointer to iterate through the workers, and another pointer to iterate through the jobs to find the `difficulty <= ability` of the worker, and find the maximum profit job for the worker during the iteration.

### Why Two Pointers?
* Since jobs are sorted by difficulty, we iterate the job from easy to hard once.
* As worker ability increases, more jobs 

> 如果把 `worker` 按照从小到大的顺序排序，那么第 `i` 个工人能做的工作，他右边的 (worker 值更大的)工人也能做。这意味着，如果我们遍历了所有 `difficulty[j] <= worker[i]` 的工作，那么从第 `i` 个工人到第 `i+1` 个工人，只需要额外遍历 `worker[i] < difficulty[j] <= worker[i+1]` 的工作。 ([Source](https://leetcode.cn/problems/most-profit-assigning-work/solutions/2780326/pai-xu-shuang-zhi-zhen-pythonjavacgojsru-gthg/))

```js
worker =         2,
difficulty  = 1, 2, 3, 5, 6
profit      = 3, 1, 7, 9, 4
                 ^     
                 3 // The maximum from difficulty <= 2    
                 
difficulty  = 1, 2, 3, _, 5, 6
worker      =    2,    4,    6
profit      = 3, 1, 7, _, 9, 4
                 ^ --> ^ --> ^  // The index moves to the right when iterating each worker, it's monotonic.
maxProfit     3  3  7  7  9  9  // max profit job for each worker that can do the job
```

For the first worker with ability `2`, we iterate the job from the beginning to `difficulty == 2`, and update the maximum profit so far, which is `3`. For the second worker with ability `4`, we iterate the job from `difficulty == 2` to `difficulty == 4`, and update the maximum profit so far, which is `7`. The job pointer is monotonic, so we can find the maximum profit job for each worker efficiently. It's similar to the precomputed maximum profit array in the binary search solution.

```kotlin
class Solution {
    fun maxProfitAssignment(difficulty: IntArray, profit: IntArray, worker: IntArray): Int {
        val n = difficulty.size
        val jobs = Array<Job>(n) {
            Job(difficulty[it], profit[it])
        }
        jobs.sortBy { it.difficulty }
        worker.sort()

        var maxProfit = 0
        var totalProfit = 0
        var jobIndex = 0
        for (i in 0 until worker.size) {
            // Iterate through the jobs to find the job with the highest profit that the worker can do, the job is monotonic now.
            // difficulty = 1, 2, 3, 4, ...
            //    workers =          4
            //     profit = 3, 1, 7, 2, ...
            //              3  3  7  7  ...
            while (jobIndex < jobs.size && jobs[jobIndex].difficulty <= worker[i]) {
                maxProfit = maxOf(maxProfit, jobs[jobIndex].profit)
                jobIndex++
            }
            totalProfit += maxProfit
        }
        return totalProfit
    }
}
```
