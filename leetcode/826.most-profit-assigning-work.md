# [826. Most Profit Assigning Work](https://leetcode.com/problems/most-profit-assigning-work/description/)

## Greedy + Binary Search
We can sort the jobs by difficulty, so we can find the last job which difficulty <= ability by binary search for each worker.

```js
difficulty = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6
             O  O  O  X  X  X
             ^^^^^^^ // The job we can assign to gain the maximum profit
                     
worker[i].ability = 3
```

For the job with difficulty <= ability, how can we find the maximum profit between the jobs within ability efficiently? We can precompute the maximum profit for each difficulty level, that is for jobs with difficulty up to `difficulty[i]`. For example, `precompute[3] = 7` means that the maximum profit for jobs with `difficulty <= 4` is `7`. **This creates a monotonic array of maximum profits.**

```js
index       = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
difficulty  = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6
profit      = 3, 1, 7, 2, 9, 4
precompute  = 3, 3, 7, 7, 9, 9
                       *
```

With the sorted jobs and the precomputed maximum profits, we can find the maximum profit for the worker by binary searching the last job which `difficulty <= ability`, and find the maximum profit from the precomputed maximum profits during the binary search.

```kotlin
data class Job(
    val difficulty: Int,
    val profit: Int
)

class Solution {
    fun maxProfitAssignment(difficulty: IntArray, profit: IntArray, worker: IntArray): Int {
        val n = difficulty.size
        val jobs = Array<Job>(n) {
            Job(difficulty[it], profit[it])
        }
        jobs.sortBy { it.difficulty }

        // Precompute the max profit for jobs with difficulty up to difficulty[i]
        // Or we can just update the profit field for each job without creating a new array.
        val maxProfitAtDifficulty = IntArray(n)
        maxProfitAtDifficulty[0] = jobs.first().profit
        for (i in 1 until n) {
            maxProfitAtDifficulty[i] = maxOf(jobs[i].profit, maxProfitAtDifficulty[i - 1])
        }

        var totalProfit = 0
        for (ability in worker) {
            // Find the last job which difficulty <= ability
            // O O O X X X
            //     ^
            var left = 0
            var right = n - 1
            var currentProfit = 0
            while (left <= right) {
                val middle = left + (right - left) / 2
                val currentJob = jobs[middle]
                if (currentJob.difficulty <= ability) {
                    // We find the maximum profit during the binary search
                    currentProfit = maxOf(currentProfit, maxProfitAtDifficulty[middle])
                    left = middle + 1
                } else {
                    right = middle - 1
                }
            }
            totalProfit += currentProfit
        }
        return totalProfit
    }
}
```

* **Space Complexity:** `O(n)`.

## Greedy + Two Pointers
We can sort the jobs by difficulty, and sort the workers by ability. Then match the job to the worker with the highest profit where the difficulty <= ability of the worker.

After sorting the jobs and workers, both arrays are monotonic, so we can iterate through the jobs and workers via two pointers to find the maximum profit job for each worker. One pointer to iterate through the workers, and another pointer to iterate through the jobs to find the difficulty <= ability of the worker, and find the maximum profit job for the worker during the iteration.

```js
worker =         2,
difficulty  = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6
profit      = 3, 1, 7, 2, 9, 4
                 ^     
                 3 // The maximum from difficulty <= 2            

difficulty  = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6
worker =         2,    4,    6
profit      = 3, 1, 7, 2, 9, 4
                 ^ --> ^ --> ^  // The index moves to the right when iterating each worker, it's monotonic.
              3  3  7  7  9  9  // max profit job for each worker that can do the job
```

For the first worker with ability `2`, we iterate the job from the beginning to `difficulty == 2`, and update the maximum profit so far, which is `3`. For the second worker with ability `4`, we iterate the job from `difficulty == 2` to `difficulty == 4`, and update the maximum profit so far, which is `7`. The job pointer is monotonic, so we can find the maximum profit job for each worker efficiently. It's similar to the precomputed maximum profit array in the binary search solution.

```kotlin
data class Job(
    val difficulty: Int,
    val profit: Int
)

class Solution {
    fun maxProfitAssignment(difficulty: IntArray, profit: IntArray, worker: IntArray): Int {
        val n = difficulty.size
        val jobs = Array<Job>(n) {
            Job(difficulty[it], profit[it])
        }
        jobs.sortBy { it.difficulty }
        worker.sort()

        var maxProfit = 0
        var totalProfit = 0
        var jobIndex = 0
        for (i in 0 until worker.size) {
            // Iterate through the jobs to find the job with the highest profit that the worker can do, the job is monotonic now.
            while (jobIndex < jobs.size && jobs[jobIndex].difficulty <= worker[i]) {
                maxProfit = maxOf(maxProfit, jobs[jobIndex].profit)
                jobIndex++
            }
            totalProfit += maxProfit
        }
        return totalProfit
    }
}
```
