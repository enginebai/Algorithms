# [817. Linked List Components](https://leetcode.com/problems/linked-list-components/description/)

## Traversal

It's a [split (group) count](https://app.heptabase.com/98654732-dead-4b2e-a851-e65eea8db00e/card/84d411d9-7f20-4462-9ae0-5ba289df2e87) problem, we iterate the list and count the number of groups. If the current node is in the set and (the next node is not in the set or **it's the end of the list**), we increase the count.

```js
set = {A, B, C, D, E}

x -> x -> A -> B -> C
          ^^^^^^^^^^^
x -> A -> B -> C -> x -> x -> D -> E -> D
     ^^^^^^^^^^^              ^^^^^^^^^^^
```

```kotlin
fun numComponents(head: ListNode?, nums: IntArray): Int {
    var count = 0
    val set = nums.toSet()
    var current = head
    var connected = false
    while (current != null) {
        if (current.`val` in set) {
            connected = true
            // If the next node is not in the set or it's the end of the list
            if (current.next == null || (current.next != null && current.next.`val` !in set)) {
                count++
            }
        } else {
            connected = false
        }
        current = current.next
    }
    return count
}
```

Or we can skip the nodes that are not in the set, then iterate the nodes in the set until we meet the next node that is not in the set, then increment the count.

```js
x, x, x, O, O, O, x, x, O, O
         ^^^^^^^        ^^^^
c1   ->  c2
         c3   ->  c4, count = 1
                  c5 -> c6
                        c7 -> c8, count = 2

```kotlin
fun numComponents(head: ListNode?, nums: IntArray): Int {
    var count = 0
    val set = nums.toSet()
    var current = head
    var inSet = false
    while (current != null) {
        // Skip all the nodes that are not in the set
        while (current != null && current.`val` !in set) {
            current = current.next
        }
        // Iterate the nodes in the set until we meet the next node that is not in the set
        while (current != null && current.`val` in set) {
            current = current.next
            inSet = true
        }
        // It might be no any node in the set, so we need to check the flag
        if (inSet) count++
        inSet = false
    }
    return count
}
```
