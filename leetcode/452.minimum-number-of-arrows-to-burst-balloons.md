# [452. Minimum Number of Arrows to Burst Balloons](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-number-of-arrows-to-burst-balloons)

## Greedy
For each balloon, we can shoot anywhere within its range to burst it, but we need to find the minimum number of arrows to burst all balloons.

Let's consider the following cases to gain some insights:

### Case 1: Single Balloon
For a single balloon, we need exactly one arrow shot anywhere within its range.

### Case 2: Multiple Balloons
* For non-overlapping balloons, we need as many arrows as the number of balloons. We need 3 arrows to burst all balloons for the following case:
```js
1---5
      6---10
             11---15
^^^^^ ^^^^^^ ^^^^^^^
```

* For overlapping balloons, we can optimize by shooting at a position that bursts multiple balloons in the **overlapping range**. For example, we can shoot anywhere between positions 3 and 5 to burst both balloons with a single arrow:
```js
1-----5
   3-----7
   ^^^^
```

For this case, we can shoot at position 5 to burst all three balloons with a single arrow.
```js
1-----5
   3-----7 
      5-----9
      ^
```

**Idea!!** To maximize the number of balloons that can be burst with a single arrow, we should shoot at the end of **earliest-ending balloon** (greedy). So we sort by *end* first, then check if the next balloon is overlapping with the current arrow shot.

```kotlin
fun findMinArrowShots(points: Array<IntArray>): Int {
    points.sortBy { it[1] }
    var shots = 1
    var minEnd = points[0][1]
    for (i in 1 until points.size) {
        val (start, end) = points[i]
        // If there is no overlap, we need a new arrow shot
        if (minEnd < start) {
            shots++
            minEnd = end
        }
    }
    return shots
}
```

### Complexity Analysis
* **Time Complexity**: `O(n log n)` - dominated by the sorting operation
* **Space Complexity**: `O(log n)` - space used by the sorting algorithm
