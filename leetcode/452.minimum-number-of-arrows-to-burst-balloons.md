## [452. Minimum Number of Arrows to Burst Balloons](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-number-of-arrows-to-burst-balloons)

For one balloon, we can shot anywhere, and require one arrow.
For two balloons (supposed they are overlapped), where to shot to gain the minimum array?

```js
1-----5
   3-----7
   ****
```

We have to shot between `3` to `5` so that we require only one arrow. How about the case below?

```js
1-----5
   3-----7 
      5-----9
      *
```

We can shot at `5` to get the minimum array. To shot the first balloon and to get the minimum array, we will **shot at the end** of first balloon.

So we will sort the balloons by the `end` position, then start shoting the first balloon, see how many balloons will brust together, and so on.

```kotlin
fun findMinArrowShots(points: Array<IntArray>): Int {
    Arrays.sort(points) { p1, p2 -> 
        p1[1] - p2[1]
    }
    var shots = 1
    var minEnd = points[0][1]
    for (i in 1 until points.size) {
        if (minEnd in points[i][0]..points[i][1]) continue
        else {
            shots++
            minEnd = points[i][1]
        }
    }
    return shots
}
```
