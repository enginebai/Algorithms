# [1325. Delete Leaves With a Given Value](https://leetcode.com/problems/delete-leaves-with-a-given-value)

## Clarification Questions
* Does the target always exist the tree?
 
## Test Cases
### Normal Cases
```
Input: 
        1
       / \
      2   3
     /   / \
    2   2   4
   /   /   /
  2   2   2
target = 2
Output: 
        1
         \
          3
           \
            4
```
### Edge / Corner Cases
* The target exists, but not in leaf.
* The remaining node becomes the new leaf after deleting, and we have to delete the new leaf.
```
Input: 
        2
     /     \
    3       4
   / \     / 
  3   7   3
target = 2

Output: 
        2
           \
            4
```
* The entire tree will be deleted.
```
Input:
2
target = 2

Output: []

Input: 
    2
   / \
  2   2
 / \ / \
2  2 2  2
target = 2

Output: []
```

## Recursive
**Idea!!** Postorder, for problem statement `Note that once you delete a leaf node with value target, if its parent node becomes a leaf node and has the value target, it should also be deleted`, so we have to process the child first, when we've done, we check the root to see if that becomes the leaf and if to delete or not.

```kotlin
fun removeLeafNodes(root: TreeNode?, target: Int): TreeNode? {
    if (root == null) return null
    root.left = removeLeafNodes(root.left, target)
    root.right = removeLeafNodes(root.right, target)

    // After deleting the children, check if the root becomes the leaf and if to delete or not.
    if (root.left == null && root.right == null && root.`val` == target) {
        return null
    }
    return root
}
```
* **Time Complexity**: `O(n)`.
* **Space Complexity**: `O(h)`.


## Iterative
> This is not optimal solution, might skip this. 
```kotlin
fun removeLeafNodes(root: TreeNode?, target: Int): TreeNode? {
    if (root == null) return null
    val parentMap = hashMapOf<TreeNode, TreeNode>()
    val queue = ArrayDeque<TreeNode>()
    val leafs = mutableListOf<TreeNode>()
    queue.addLast(root)
    while (queue.isNotEmpty()) {
        val node = queue.removeFirst()
        if (node.left == null && node.right == null) {
            leafs.add(node)
            continue
        }
        if (node.left != null) {
            queue.addLast(node.left)
            parentMap[node.left] = node
        }
        if (node.right != null) {
            queue.addLast(node.right)
            parentMap[node.right] = node
        }
    }

    for (leaf in leafs) {
        var current = leaf
        var parent = parentMap[current]
        while (current.`val` == target && current.left == null && current.right == null) {
            if (parent == null) return null
            
            if (current == parent!!.left) parent!!.left = null
            else parent!!.right = null

            current = parent!!
            parent = parentMap[parent!!]
        }
    }
    return root
}
```
