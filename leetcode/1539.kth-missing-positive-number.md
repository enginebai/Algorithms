# [1539. Kth Missing Positive Number](https://leetcode.com/problems/kth-missing-positive-number/)

## Brute Force
We just iterate all possible positive numbers and increment the missing count if the number is not in the array.

```kotlin
    fun findKthPositive(arr: IntArray, k: Int): Int {
        val set = arr.toSet()
        var missing = 0
        for (i in 1..10000) {
            if (i !in set) {
                missing++
            }
            if (missing == k) return i
        }
        return -1
    }
```

- **Time Complexity**: `O(U)`, where `U` is the upper bound of the missing number.
- **Space Complexity**: `O(n)`

## Binary Search
Given a sorted array `arr` of distinct positive integers, and a number `k`, we want to find the `k`-th missing positive integer from the sequence `1, 2, 3, ...`.

### Key Insights
The expected value at index `i` (0-based) should be `i + 1`, because the array is supported to have `1, 2, 3, ...` as its elements.

But the actual value at index `i` is `arr[i]`. So the number of missing numbers at index `i` is **`arr[i] - (i + 1)`**. The expected value should have increased by 1 each step, but instead they increased **faster**, so some numbers are skipped (missing).

```js
actual   = [2, 3, 5]
expected =  1, 2, 3
           +1           // Missing 1
              +1        // Missing 1
                 +2     // Missing 1, 4
        
```

We can binary search the first index `i` such that `arr[i] - (i + 1) >= k`. Then the answer is `i + k`, because:
- `i` numbers are aleady in `arr`.
- The missing count is `k` at index `i`.

So the `k-th` missing number is just before `arr[i]`, which means `i + k`.

> But what if we don't find such an index `i`? 

This is the case all numbers in `arr` are correct, it means the k-th missing number is **after the entire array**, such as `[1, 2, 3]`. In our binary search, `left` will stop at `arr.size`, and `left + k` will be the answer.

```kotlin
fun findKthPositive(arr: IntArray, k: Int): Int {
    var left = 0
    var right = arr.size - 1
    while (left <= right) {
        val middle = left + (right - left) / 2
        val missingCount = arr[middle] - (middle + 1)
        if (missingCount >= k) {
            right = middle - 1
        } else {
            left = middle + 1
        }
    }
    return left + k
}
```

- **Time Complexity**: `O(log n)`
- **Space Complexity**: `O(1)`
