# Approach
It's similar to [572. Subtree of Another Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/subtree-of-another-tree/), but we need to check if the linked list is a "substring" of the tree, not a subtree. (All the node in linked list have to be in the tree, but not all tree nodes have to be in the linked list.)

```kotlin
fun isSubPath(head: ListNode?, root: TreeNode?): Boolean {
    // Slight different between `contains()`, we have to decide base on the definition of this recursive function.
    if (head == null && root == null) return true   // Both are empty, is a subpath.
    if (head == null || root == null) return false  // One of them is empty, is not a subpath.

    // Search the linked list starting from the root node.
    return contains(head, root) ||
        isSubPath(head, root.left) || isSubPath(head, root.right) // Or search the linked list in the left and right subtree.
}

private fun contains(head: ListNode?, root: TreeNode?): Boolean {
    // Tree contains empty list or we reach the end of the list, then it's a subpath.
    if (head == null) return true
    // It means we have reached the end of the tree, but the linked list is not found.
    if (root == null) return false

    // Keep searching the linked list in the tree.
    return head.`val` == root.`val` && (contains(head.next, root.left) || contains(head.next, root.right))
}
```

* **Time Complexity:** `O(N * M)`, where `N` is the number of nodes in the tree and `M` is the number of nodes in the linked list.
* **Space Complexity:** `O(N + M)`, we have to travesal the tree `O(N)` and we check `contain()` which takes `O(M)` space in each tree node.
