# [2336. Smallest Number in Infinite Set](https://leetcode.com/problems/smallest-number-in-infinite-set/description/)

## Test Cases
### Edge / Corner Cases
```js
1, 2, 3, 4, 5
X  X  X  X  O // pop 4 times

1, 2, 3, 4, 5
X  O  O  X  O // add 2, 3 back

pop() = 2
pop() = 3
pop() = 5 // It's 5, not 4
```

```js
add(2) // add the number that is still in the set
pop() = 1
```

## Heap + Set (or `TreeSet`)
We can add all possible numbers to the set as the initial set, and use a minimum heap to find the smallest number in the set, including the numbers that are added back. But this approach is not efficient, because the set could be infinite.

How can we solve this problem efficiently? Let's break down the problem:
* If we don't add number back, we can just use a variable to store the current smallest number in the infinite set. 
* If we support adding numbers back, we need a data structure that can find the smallest number dynamically, which is heap. And we need a set to avoid duplicate adding. So if we add the number back, we can add it to the heap and set.

```js
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, ...
X  X  X  X  |
            | -----> // handle by `num`
            num
  <------|  
// handle by heap and set 
```

To summarize to our approach:
* `popSmallest()`: we check if heap is empty, if not, there are some numbers added back, we just pop the smallest number from the heap. If the heap is empty, we return the current smallest number in the infinite set, that is maintained by a variable.
* `addBack(number)`: we check if the number is still in the infinite set, if not, we add it to the heap and set.

```js
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, ...
X  X  X  X  |
            | 
            num
               add(6) // num < 6: It's still in the infinite set

add(1) // add 1 to heap and set
pop() = 1
            pop() = 5
```

```kotlin
class SmallestInfiniteSet() {
    // The smallest number in the infinite set.
    private var currentSmallest = 1

    // The heap and set to store the numbers that are added back.
    private val minHeap = PriorityQueue<Int>()
    private val set = HashSet<Int>()

    fun popSmallest(): Int {
        // If we have added some numbers back, we just pop the smallest number from the heap.
        if (set.isNotEmpty()) {
            val value = minHeap.poll()
            set.remove(value)
            return value
        } else {
            // Otherwise, we just return the current smallest number in the infinite set.
            return currentSmallest++
        }
    }

    fun addBack(number: Int) {
        if (currentSmallest <= number || // If we add the number that is still in the infinite set.
            set.contains(number)) { // Or we add the number that is already added back.
            return
        }

        set.add(number)
        minHeap.add(number)
    }
}

// Or equivalently using TreeSet
class SmallestInfiniteSet() {
    private val set = TreeSet<Int>() // To store the numbers that are removed and added back
    private var currentSmallest = 1

    fun popSmallest(): Int {
        if (set.isNotEmpty()) {
            val value = set.pollFirst()
            return value
        } else {
            return currentSmallest++
        }
    }

    fun addBack(number: Int) {
        if (currentSmallest <= number || set.contains(number)) return
        set.add(number)
    }
}
```

* **Time Complexity:** `O(log n)` for `popSmallest()`, `O(log n)` for `addBack()`
* **Space Complexity:** `O(n)`
