## [881. Boats to Save People](https://leetcode.com/problems/boats-to-save-people/description/)

### Greedy
**Idead!!** Put the heaviest person first, then see if we can put the lightest person with the heaviest person in the same boat.

Why do we put the heaviest person first rather than the lightest person?
* The heaviest person is the most difficult to fit with other people. By picking the heaviest person first and try to pair with the lighest person, we can make the best use of the boat capacity.
* If we pick lighter people first, it might find that the heaviest person cannot be paired with anyone left, requiring a new boat.

```js
weights = [1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 4], limit = 5

// Pick the heaviest person first
(1, 4) / (1, 4) / (2, 3) = 3 boats

// Pick the lightest person first
(1, 1, 2) / (3) / (4) / (4) = 4 boats
```

The greedy approach of picking the heaviest person first ensures that we're make the best use of the boat capacity, minimizing the chances that the heaviest person cannot be paired with anyone left and an additional boat is required.

> Edge case: `[3,3,2], limit = 5`, there will be one person left in the end. The total number of people is odd.

```kotlin
fun numRescueBoats(people: IntArray, limit: Int): Int {
    // We sort the people by weight first so that we can put the heaviest person first
    people.sort()
    var boatsCount = 0
    var left = 0
    var right = people.size - 1
    while (left <= right) {
        var remaining = limit - people[right]
        right--
        if (left <= right && people[left] <= remaining) {
            left++
        }
        boatsCount++
    }
    return boatsCount
}
```
