## [881. Boats to Save People](https://leetcode.com/problems/boats-to-save-people/description/)

### Greedy
**Idead!!** Put the heaviest person first, then see if we can put the lightest person with the heaviest person in the same boat.

```kotlin
fun numRescueBoats(people: IntArray, limit: Int): Int {
    people.sort()
    var boatsCount = 0
    var left = 0
    var right = people.size - 1
    while (left <= right) {
        var remaining = limit - people[right]
        right--
        if (left <= right && people[left] <= remaining) {
            left++
        }
        boatsCount++
    }
    return boatsCount
}
