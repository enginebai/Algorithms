# [1845. Seat Reservation Manager](https://leetcode.com/problems/seat-reservation-manager/submissions/)

## Heap
We initailze a priority queue with all the seats. When we reserve a seat, we poll the top element from the queue. When we unreserve a seat, we add the seat number back to the queue.
```kotlin
class SeatManager(private val n: Int) {

    private val seats = PriorityQueue<Int>()

    init {
        (1..n).forEach {
            seats.add(it)
        }
    }

    fun reserve(): Int {
        return seats.poll()
    }

    fun unreserve(seatNumber: Int) {
        seats.add(seatNumber)
    }

}
```

* **Time Complexity:** `O(log n)` for reserve and unreserve operations, and `O(n)` for initialization, total is `O(n log n)`.
* **Space Complexity:** `O(n)` for priority queue.

Another solution is to use a marker variable, if we don't unreverse the seat, then the smallest-numbered unreserved seat is always monotonic increasing. We can use a variable to store the smallest unreserved seat number, and increase it by 1 when we reserve a seat.

It guarantees that we invoke `unreserve(x)` after `reserve()`, so `x < marker`. We use a min heap to maintain the unreserved seats, similar idea as [2336. Smallest Number in Infinite Set](../leetcode/2336.smallest-number-in-infinite-set.md).

```js
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, ...
            |---> marker
|--heap--|
```

```kotlin
class SeatManager(private val n: Int) {

    private var marker = 1
    private val unreservedSeats = PriorityQueue<Int>()
    
    fun reserve(): Int {
        if (unreservedSeats.isEmpty()) {
            return marker++
        }
        return unreservedSeats.poll()
    }

    fun unreserve(seatNumber: Int) {
        unreservedSeats.add(seatNumber)
    }
}
```

* **Time Complexity:** `O(log n)` for reserve and unreserve operations, and `O(1)` for initialization, total is `O(n log n)`.
* **Space Complexity:** `O(q)` for priority queue.
