### Traversal
The first approach is to find the "closed" region, we can start from the first `'O'` and traverse the graph to find the regions that are surrounded by `'X'`. For the region that is surrounded by `'X'`, it will not reach the boundary of the graph and the base case is to meet `'X'` or visited cell. We can use either DFS or BFS to traverse the graph.

```kotlin
class Solution {
    
    private val regions = hashSetOf<Pair<Int, Int>>()
    private val visited = hashSetOf<Pair<Int, Int>>()
    
    fun solve(board: Array<CharArray>): Unit {
        for (m in 0 until board.size) {
            for (n in 0 until board[m].size) {
                if (board[m][n] == 'O' && !visited.contains(m to n)) {
                    val currentRegions = hashSetOf<Pair<Int, Int>>()
                    if (dfs(board, m, n, currentRegions)) {
                        regions.addAll(currentRegions)
                    }
                }
            }
        }
        
        regions.forEach {
            board[it.first][it.second] = 'X'
        }
    }
    
    private fun dfs(board: Array<CharArray>, x: Int, y: Int, regions: HashSet<Pair<Int, Int>>): Boolean {
        if (x < 0 || y < 0 || x > board.size - 1 || y > board[0].size - 1) return false
        if (board[x][y] == 'X' || visited.contains(x to y)) return true
        
        visited.add(x to y)
        regions.add(x to y)
        
        val up = dfs(board, x - 1, y, regions)
        val down = dfs(board, x + 1, y, regions)
        val left = dfs(board, x, y - 1, regions)
        val right = dfs(board, x, y + 1, regions)
        return up && down && left && right
    }
}
```

### Bounary DFS
The second approach is the reverse of the first approach. We need to find "non-closed" region first. We start from four boundaries, and find the regions we don't capture, and iterate the whole board again to capture the closed regions.

```kotlin
private val directions = arrayOf(
    intArrayOf(-1, 0),
    intArrayOf(1, 0),
    intArrayOf(0, -1),
    intArrayOf(0, 1)
)
private val notCapture = 'A'

fun solve(board: Array<CharArray>): Unit {
    val m = board.size
    val n = board[0].size
    // First row
    for (c in 0 until n) {
        dfs(board, 0, c)
    }
    // First col
    for (r in 0 until m) {
        dfs(board, r, 0)
    }
    
    // Last row
    for (c in 0 until n) {
        dfs(board, m - 1, c)
    }
    
    // Last col
    for (r in 0 until m) {
        dfs(board, r, n - 1)
    }
    
    for (i in 0 until m) {
        for (j in 0 until n) {
            // Capture
            if (board[i][j] == 'O') board[i][j] = 'X'
            // Recover
            else if (board[i][j] == notCapture) board[i][j] = 'O' 
        }
    }
}

private fun dfs(board: Array<CharArray>, x: Int, y: Int) {
    if (x < 0 || x >= board.size || y < 0 || y >= board[0].size || board[x][y] != 'O') return
    board[x][y] = notCapture
    directions.forEach { d -> 
        dfs(board, x + d[0], y + d[1])
    }
}
```
