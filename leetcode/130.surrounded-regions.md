## Test Cases

Input: 
O X X
O O X
O X X
Output:

## Traversal
We can traverse all `O` that are "surrounded" by `X`. (Finding the closed island, DFS or BFS both work), we define `dfs()` function that returns `true` if the region is surrounded by `X`:

* `O`: Keep traversing the adjacent cells.
* `X`: True, because it's surrounded by `X`.
* Visited: True, because we don't need to traverse the visited cell.
* Out of bound: False, because it's not surrounded by `X`.

### Pitfalls
Here is an important note: **We don't early return `false` if the cell is out of bound or visited, because we need to traverse the whole region to mark the visited cells.**

There are some pitfalls that leads to WA:
```kotlin
directions.forEach { adj ->
    // left result will be false if the right result is false, and early return
    // dfs() won't be invoke and the visited cell won't be marked
    result = result & dfs(grid, x + adj[0], y + adj[1])
}

// Or early return in this way, this leads to WA as well.
directions.forEach { adj ->
    if (!dfs(grid, x + adj[0], y + adj[1])) return false
}
```

```kotlin
fun solve(board: Array<CharArray>): Unit {
    val m = board.size
    val n = board[0].size
    
    // All surrounded regions
    val regions = hashSetOf<Pair<Int, Int>>()
    for (x in 0 until m) {
        for (y in 0 until n) {
            if (board[x][y] == 'O' && !regions.contains(x to y)) {
                val visited = hashSetOf<Pair<Int, Int>>()
                if (dfs(board, x, y, visited)) {
                    regions.addAll(visited)
                }
            }
        }
    }
    
    regions.forEach {
        board[it.first][it.second] = 'X'
    }
}

private fun dfs(board: Array<CharArray>, x: Int, y: Int, visited: HashSet<Pair<Int, Int>>): Boolean {
    val m = board.size
    val n = board[0].size
    if (x !in 0 until m || y !in 0 until n) return false
    if (visited.contains(x to y)) return true
    if (board[x][y] == 'X') return true

    visited.add(x to y)
    var result = true
    for (d in directions) {
        val newX = x + d[0]
        val newY = y + d[1]
        result = dfs(board, newX, newY, visited) && result
    }
    return result
}
```

### Bounary Traversal
Alternatively, we can find "non-closed" region first. We start traversing from four boundaries (DFS or BFS), and find the regions that are not surrounded, and iterate the whole board again to capture the closed regions.

```kotlin
private val notCapture = 'A'

fun solve(board: Array<CharArray>): Unit {
    val m = board.size
    val n = board[0].size
    // First row
    for (c in 0 until n) {
        dfs(board, 0, c)
    }
    // First col
    for (r in 0 until m) {
        dfs(board, r, 0)
    }
    
    // Last row
    for (c in 0 until n) {
        dfs(board, m - 1, c)
    }
    
    // Last col
    for (r in 0 until m) {
        dfs(board, r, n - 1)
    }
    
    for (i in 0 until m) {
        for (j in 0 until n) {
            // Capture
            if (board[i][j] == 'O') board[i][j] = 'X'
            // Recover
            else if (board[i][j] == notCapture) board[i][j] = 'O' 
        }
    }
}

private fun dfs(board: Array<CharArray>, x: Int, y: Int) {
    if (x < 0 || x >= board.size || y < 0 || y >= board[0].size || board[x][y] != 'O') return
    board[x][y] = notCapture
    directions.forEach { d -> 
        dfs(board, x + d[0], y + d[1])
    }
}
```
