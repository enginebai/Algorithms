### Traversal
We can traverse all `O` that are "surrounded" by `X`. (Finding the closed island, DFS or BFS both work), we define `dfs()` function that returns `true` if the region is surrounded by `X`:
* `O`: Keep traversing the adjacent cells.
* `X`: True, because it's surrounded by `X`.
* Visited: True, because we don't need to traverse the visited cell.
* Out of bound: False, because it's not surrounded by `X`.

Here is an important note: **We don't early return `false` if the cell is out of bound or visited, because we need to traverse the whole region to mark the visited cells.**

There are some pitfalls that leads to WA:
```kotlin
directions.forEach { adj ->
    // left result will be false if the right result is false, and early return
    // dfs() won't be invoke and the visited cell won't be marked
    result = result & dfs(grid, x + adj[0], y + adj[1])
}

// Or early return in this way, this leads to WA as well.
directions.forEach { adj ->
    if (!dfs(grid, x + adj[0], y + adj[1])) return false
}
```

```kotlin
class Solution {
    
    // All surrounded regions
    private val regions = hashSetOf<Pair<Int, Int>>()
    
    fun solve(board: Array<CharArray>): Unit {
        for (m in 0 until board.size) {
            for (n in 0 until board[m].size) {
                if (board[m][n] == 'O' && !visited.contains(m to n)) {
                    val currentRegions = hashSetOf<Pair<Int, Int>>()
                    if (dfs(board, m, n, currentRegions)) {
                        regions.addAll(currentRegions)
                    }
                }
            }
        }
        
        regions.forEach {
            board[it.first][it.second] = 'X'
        }
    }
    
    private fun dfs(board: Array<CharArray>, x: Int, y: Int, visited: HashSet<Pair<Int, Int>>): Boolean {
        if (x < 0 || y < 0 || x > board.size - 1 || y > board[0].size - 1) return false
        if (board[x][y] == 'X' || visited.contains(x to y)) return true
        
        visited.add(x to y)

        var result = true
        directions.forEach { adj -> 
            result = dfs(board, x + adj[0], y + adj[1], regions) & result
        }
        return result

        // Or equivalently, we can write in this way:
        // val up = dfs(board, x - 1, y, regions)
        // val down = dfs(board, x + 1, y, regions)
        // val left = dfs(board, x, y - 1, regions)
        // val right = dfs(board, x, y + 1, regions)
        // return up && down && left && right
    }
}
```

### Bounary Traversal
Alternatively, we can find "non-closed" region first. We start traversing from four boundaries (DFS or BFS), and find the regions that are not surrounded, and iterate the whole board again to capture the closed regions.

```kotlin
private val directions = arrayOf(
    intArrayOf(-1, 0),
    intArrayOf(1, 0),
    intArrayOf(0, -1),
    intArrayOf(0, 1)
)
private val notCapture = 'A'

fun solve(board: Array<CharArray>): Unit {
    val m = board.size
    val n = board[0].size
    // First row
    for (c in 0 until n) {
        dfs(board, 0, c)
    }
    // First col
    for (r in 0 until m) {
        dfs(board, r, 0)
    }
    
    // Last row
    for (c in 0 until n) {
        dfs(board, m - 1, c)
    }
    
    // Last col
    for (r in 0 until m) {
        dfs(board, r, n - 1)
    }
    
    for (i in 0 until m) {
        for (j in 0 until n) {
            // Capture
            if (board[i][j] == 'O') board[i][j] = 'X'
            // Recover
            else if (board[i][j] == notCapture) board[i][j] = 'O' 
        }
    }
}

private fun dfs(board: Array<CharArray>, x: Int, y: Int) {
    if (x < 0 || x >= board.size || y < 0 || y >= board[0].size || board[x][y] != 'O') return
    board[x][y] = notCapture
    directions.forEach { d -> 
        dfs(board, x + d[0], y + d[1])
    }
}
```
