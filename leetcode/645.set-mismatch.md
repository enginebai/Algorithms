## [645. Set Mismatch](https://leetcode.com/problems/set-mismatch)

### Hash Table
Since the value of input array ranges from `1..n`, and we're going to find the duplicate and missing, we can use input array itself as hash table and index as key (`value - 1`), then iterate every number and mark the number as negative (seen).

* The number is already negative, we've seen this before, it's duplicate.
* Then iterate again to see which number has not been seen (positive).


```kotlin
fun findErrorNums(nums: IntArray): IntArray {
    var duplicate = 0
    for (i in 0 until nums.size) {
        val index = abs(nums[i]) - 1
        if (nums[index] < 0) {
            duplicate = index + 1
        } else {
            nums[index] = -nums[index]
        }
    }
    var missing = 0
    for (i in 0 until nums.size) {
        if (nums[i] > 0) {
            missing = i + 1
            break
        }
    }
    return intArrayOf(duplicate, missing)
}
```

* **Time Complexity**: `O(n)`.
* **Space Complexity**: `O(1)`.
