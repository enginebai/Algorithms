# [1855. Maximum Distance Between a Pair of Values](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-distance-between-a-pair-of-values/description/)

## Hints
- What if you fix an index in `nums1` and try to find the rightmost valid index in `nums2`?
- Both arrays are non-increasing. Can you leverage this property for efficient search?
- Is there a way to avoid checking every possible pair?

## Breakdowns
> 1. For each index `i` in `nums1`, how do you efficiently find the largest `j` in `nums2` such that `nums1[i] <= nums2[j]` and `i <= j`?

Try binary search or two pointers in sorted array to avoid brute force.

> 2. Can you process both arrays in a single pass?

Try to use two pointers to move forward only when the condition is met.

## Key Insights
For each `i`, you want the rightmost `j` (with `i <= j`) such that `nums1[i] <= nums2[j]`.

The problem is a classic two pointers or binary search on sorted arrays pattern. Due to the sorted nature, this is perfect for:
- Binary search: To find the rightmost `j` for each `i` in logarithmic time.
- Two pointers: Since both arrays are non-increasing, for each `i`, the valid `j` (where `nums1[i] <= nums2[j]`) is monotonic: as `i` increases, the possible `j` does not decrease.

## Binary Search
Give the first number `nums1[i]`, there are three cases below, and we're looking for the last number `nums2[j]` that satisfies the condition: `nums1[i] <= nums2[j]`.

```js
                 nums1[i]

// in nums2
|------------|--------------|-------------|
  > nums1[i]   == nums1[i]  ^  < nums1[i]
                            |
                            * The last number that satisfies the condition
```
We can iterate through `nums1` and use binary search to find the upper bound of `nums1[i]` in `nums2`, that is to find the last index `j` in `nums2` such that `nums2[j] >= nums1[i]` and `j >= i`. This leverages the non-increasing order of both arrays.

```kotlin
fun maxDistance(nums1: IntArray, nums2: IntArray): Int {
    var maxDistance = 0
    for (i in nums1.indices) {
        val j = upperBound(nums2, nums1[i])
        if (j - i > 0) {
            maxDistance = maxOf(maxDistance, j - i)
        }
    }
    return maxDistance
}

/**
 * Search for the last element s.t. target <= nums[j] (nums1[i] <= nums2[j]).
 */
private fun upperBound(nums: IntArray, target: Int): Int {
    var left = 0
    var right = nums.size - 1
    while (left <= right) {
        val middle = left + (right - left) / 2
        val feasible = target <= nums[middle]
        if (feasible) {
            left = middle + 1
        } else {
            right = middle - 1
        }
    }
    return right
}
```

- **Time Complexity**: `O(m log n)` where `m` is the length of `nums1` and `n` is the length of `nums2`.
- **Space Complexity**: `O(1)`

## Two Pointers
For each `i`:
1. As long as the condition `nums1[i] <= nums2[j]` is met, we can move `j` as far as possible. We update the answer with the maximum distance while `j` is moving. (The first implementation) Or we can move `j` to the rightmost position until the condition is not met, then update the answer. (The second implementation)
2. If the condition is not met, we move `i` to the next position.

```kotlin
fun maxDistance(nums1: IntArray, nums2: IntArray): Int {
    val n = nums2.size
    var j = 0
    var maxDistance = 0
    for (i in nums1.indices) {
        while (j < n && nums1[i] <= nums2[j]) {
            j++
        }
        maxDistance = maxOf(maxDistance, j - 1 - i)
    }
    return maxDistance
}

// Or equivalently
fun maxDistance(nums1: IntArray, nums2: IntArray): Int {
    val m = nums1.size
    val n = nums2.size
    var i = 0
    var j = 0
    var maxDistance = 0
    while (i < m && j < n) {
        val first = nums1[i]
        val second = nums2[j]
        if (first <= second) {
            maxDistance = maxOf(maxDistance, j - i)
            j++
        } else {
            i++
        }
    }
    return maxDistance
}
```

- **Time Complexity**: `O(m + n)`
- **Space Complexity**: `O(1)`

## Edge Cases
- `nums1` or `nums2` has only one element.
- All elements in `nums1` are greater than those in `nums2` (should return 0).
- All elements in `nums1` are less than or equal to those in `nums2` (should return the largest possible distance).
- The valid pair is only at the start or end of the arrays.
- Arrays with duplicate values.

## Pitfalls
- Forgetting to check `j >= i` (the problem requires `i <= j`).
- Not handling the case when no valid `j` exists for a given `i` (should not update the answer in this case).
