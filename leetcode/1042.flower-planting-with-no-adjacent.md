# [1042. Flower Planting With No Adjacent](https://leetcode.com/problems/flower-planting-with-no-adjacent/)

## Traversal
This is a graph coloring problem:
- Gardens = nodes
- Paths = edges
- Colors = `(1..4)`, 4 types of flowers.
- Each garden has no adjacent gardens with the same type of flower, and each garden can have at most 3 neighbors.

Each node has degree `<= 3` and we have `4` colors, so we can use a greedy algorithm to color the graph: For each node, we iterate all colors and assign the first available color to the node (greedy).

> Since each node has â‰¤ 3 neighbors, there is always at least one of the 4 types available.

```kotlin
fun gardenNoAdj(n: Int, paths: Array<IntArray>): IntArray {
    val graph = buildGraph(n, paths)
    val answer = IntArray(n)
    for (i in 0 until n) {
        if (answer[i] == 0) {
            dfs(graph, i, answer)
        }
    }
    return answer
}

private fun dfs(graph: Array<HashSet<Int>>, i: Int, answer: IntArray) {
    if (answer[i] != 0) return

    val types = (1..4).toHashSet()
    for (adj in graph[i]) {
        val adjType = answer[adj]
        types.remove(adjType)
    }
    answer[i] = types.first()
    graph[i].forEach { adj ->
        dfs(graph, adj, answer)
    }
}

private fun buildGraph(n: Int, paths: Array<IntArray>): Array<HashSet<Int>> {
    val graph = Array(n) { HashSet<Int>() }
    for ((x, y) in paths) {
        // Minus 1 for 0-indexed
        graph[x - 1].add(y - 1)
        graph[y - 1].add(x - 1)
    }
    return graph
}
