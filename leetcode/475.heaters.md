# [475. Heaters](https://leetcode.com/problems/heaters/)

## Binary Search
For each house, we have to find the closest left and right heater that can cover it, that would be the minimum distance between the house and the heater. Then we 
To find the minimum radius that can cover all houses, we have to find the maximum distance between each house and the nearest heater. And for each house, we should find the left and right closest heater that can cover it. To find the closest heater, we should sort the heaters array first, then we can use binary search to find the closest heater.

> 对于每个房屋，要么用前面的暖气，要么用后面的，二者取近的，得到距离。

```js
0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12
   *        H                  *
   |---3----|--------6---------|
heaterA                     heaterB
```

* Left closest heater: Binary search the last heater <= house[i].
```js
O, O, O, O, X, X, X
         ^    
               House
```
* Right closest heater: Binary search the first heater >= house[i].
```js
X, X, X, X, O, O, O
            ^        
  House
```

Furthermore, we also have to handle some corner cases:
* The last house is on the left of the first heater: `heater[0] - house[i]`
```js
                *      * 
H1  H2
hourse          heater
```

* The first house is on the right of the last heater: `house[i] - heater[n-1]` (`n` is the size of the heaters array)
```js
                H1  H2
*      * 
heater          hourse
```

```kotlin
fun findRadius(houses: IntArray, heaters: IntArray): Int {
    val m = houses.size
    val n = heaters.size
    heaters.sort()

    var minRadius = 0
    for (i in 0 until m) {
        val distance = if (houses[i] <= heaters[0]) {
            heaters[0] - houses[i]
        } else if (heaters[n - 1] <= houses[i]) {
            houses[i] - heaters[n - 1]
        } else {
            val leftDistance = searchLeftHeater(heaters, houses[i])
            val rightDistance = searchRightHeater(heaters, houses[i])
            minOf(leftDistance, rightDistance)
        }
        minRadius = maxOf(minRadius, distance)
    }
    return minRadius
}

// find left heater, binary search the last heater <= num
private fun searchLeftHeater(heaters: IntArray, house: Int): Int {
    var left = 0
    var right = heaters.size - 1
    while (left <= right) {
        val middle = left + (right - left) / 2
        if (heaters[middle] > house) {
            right = middle - 1
        } else if (heaters[middle] < house) {
            left = middle + 1
        } else {
            left = middle + 1
        }
    }
    return if (right in 0 until heaters.size) (house - heaters[right]) else Int.MAX_VALUE
}

// find right heater, binary search the first heater >= num
private fun searchRightHeater(heaters: IntArray, house: Int): Int {
    var left = 0
    var right = heaters.size - 1
    while (left <= right) {
        val middle = left + (right - left) / 2
        if (heaters[middle] > house) {
            right = middle - 1
        } else if (heaters[middle] < house) {
            left = middle + 1
        } else {
            right = middle - 1
        }
    }

    
    return if (left in 0 until heaters.size) (heaters[left] - house) else Int.MAX_VALUE
}
```

* **Time Complexity:** `O((n * log n + m * log n)` where `n` is the size of the heaters array and `m` is the size of the houses array:
    * `O(n * log n)` for sorting the heaters array.
    * `O(m * log n)` for binary search the closest heater for each house.
* **Space Complexity:** `O(log n)` for sorting.

## Two Pointers
If we have sorted the houses and heaters array, we can iterate each house in order and then find the left and right closest heater for it. We can use two pointers to house and heater, and move the heater pointer to the right until the heater is greater than or equal to the house. Then the current and previous position of the heater can be the left and right closest heater for the house.

```js
houses              h1,      h2
                    i
heaters  * *    *       * 
         j -----------> j   (right heater)
                ^    j - 1  (left heater)
```

```kotlin
fun findRadius(houses: IntArray, heaters: IntArray): Int {
    val m = houses.size
    val n = heaters.size
    houses.sort()
    heaters.sort()

    var minRadius = 0
    var j = 0 // heater index
    for (i in 0 until m) {
        // We move to the closest "right" heater (heater[j] >= house[i]).
        // heaters  * *    *       * 
        //          j -----------> j
        // houses              h1,      h2
        while (j < heaters.size && heaters[j] < houses[i]) j++

        val distance = if (j == 0) {
            heaters[0] - houses[i]
        } else if (j == n) {
            houses[i] - heaters[j - 1]
        } else {
            val leftDistance = houses[i] - heaters[j - 1]
            val rightDistance = heaters[j] - houses[i]
            minOf(leftDistance, rightDistance)
        }
        minRadius = maxOf(minRadius, distance)
    }
    
    return minRadius
}
```

* **Time Complexity:** `O(n * log n + m * log m + (m + n))` = `O(n log n + m * log m)` where `n` is the size of the heaters array and `m` is the size of the houses array:
    * `O(n * log n)` for sorting the heaters array.
    * `O(m * log m)` for sorting the houses array.
* **Space Complexity:** `O(log n + log m)` for sorting.
