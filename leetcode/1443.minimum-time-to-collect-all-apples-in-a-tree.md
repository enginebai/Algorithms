> 1. How to calculate the time to traverse (the number of edges) from the root to each leaf node?
```js
            0           dfs(0) = 8
         /     \         
        1       2     (dfs(1) + 2) + (dfs(2) + 2) = 4 + 2 + 0 + 2 = 8
      /   \     
     3     4     dfs(1) = (dfs(3) + 2) + (dfs(4) + 2) = 0 + 2 + 0 + 2 = 4
                        
    dfs(3) = (dfs(null) + 0) + (dfs(null) + 0) = 0
           dfs(4) = (dfs(null) + 0) + (dfs(null) + 0) = 0
                        
```

## DFS
To find the minimum time to collect all apples, we can use DFS to traverse the tree. We define `dfs(root)` as the time to collect all apples in the subtree rooted at `root`. For each root, we can calculate the time to collect all apples in the subtree (postorder), then add the time to traverse from the root to the subtree if there are apples in the subtree. 

```js
           dfs(root)
 +2 or 0  /         \ +2 or 0
    dfs(left)      dfs(right)
```

`dfs(root)` will be:
1. The sum of `2 + dfs(child)` if there are apples in the subtree of the child node or the child node itself.
2. `0` if there are no any apples in the subtree of the child node, including child node itself.

There are several possible cases:
* There are apples in the subtree in child node, that is `dfs(left) > 0`, so `dfs(root) = 2 + dfs(left) = 2 + 2 = 4`
```js
        dfs(root)
        /       +2
       X   dfs(left) = 2
     /   \
    O     X

        dfs(root)
        /       +2
       O   dfs(left) = 2
     /   \
    O     X
```
* There are no apples in the subtree of child node `dfs(left) == 0`, but there is an apple in the left or right child: `dfs(root) = 2 + dfs(left) = 2 + 0 = 2`
```js
        dfs(root)
        /       +2
       O   dfs(left) = 0
     /   \
    X     X
```
* There are no apples in the subtree, and no apple in the left or right child: `dfs(root) = 0`
```js
        dfs(root)
        /       0
       X   dfs(left) = 0
     /   \
    X     X
```

* Root has an apple or not: Here we **don't care about** if the root has an apple or not, because the time to collect the apple is `0`. And the time to collect the apple in current root will be calculated in the parent node, or `0` for top-level root.

```kotlin
fun minTime(n: Int, edges: Array<IntArray>, hasApple: List<Boolean>): Int {
    val tree = buildTree(edges)
    return dfs(tree, 0, hasApple, 0, BooleanArray(n))
}

private fun buildTree(edges: Array<IntArray>): HashMap<Int, HashSet<Int>> {
    val tree = HashMap<Int, HashSet<Int>>()
    for (e in edges) {
        // a -> b
        val a = e[0]
        val b = e[1]
        if (!tree.containsKey(a)) tree[a] = HashSet<Int>()
        if (!tree.containsKey(b)) tree[b] = HashSet<Int>()
        tree[a]!!.add(b)
        tree[b]!!.add(a)
    }
    return tree
}

// Without visited, but parent node to avoid going back to the parent node
private fun dfs(
    tree: HashMap<Int, HashSet<Int>>,
    root: Int,
    parent: Int?,
    hasApple: List<Boolean>
): Int {
    var totalTime = 0
    tree[root]?.forEach { child ->
        if (child != parent) {
            val childTime = dfs(tree, child, root, hasApple)
            /**
             * childTime > 0: There are apples in the subtree of child node
             *          root  dfs(root) = 2 + dfs(child) = 4
             *         /    
             *        X       dfs(child) = 2
             *       /     
             *      O     
             * hasApple[child]: There is an apple in the child, but there may not be apples in the subtree
             *          root  dfs(root) = 2 + dfs(child) = 2
             *         /    
             *        O       dfs(child) = 0 but hasApple[child] = true
             *       /     
             *      X     
             */
            if (childTime > 0) {
                totalTime += childTime + 2
            } else if (hasApple[child]) {
                totalTime += 2
            }
        }
    }
    return totalTime
}

// With visited and distance
private fun dfs(
    tree: HashMap<Int, HashSet<Int>>, 
    root: Int, 
    hasApple: List<Boolean>, 
    distance: Int,
    visited: BooleanArray
): Int {
    if (visited[root]) return 0
    visited[root] = true
    var childrenDistance = 0

    tree[root]?.forEach { child ->
        childrenDistance += dfs(tree, child, hasApple, 2, visited)
    }
    return if (childrenDistance == 0 && hasApple[root] == false) 0
            else childrenDistance + distance
}
