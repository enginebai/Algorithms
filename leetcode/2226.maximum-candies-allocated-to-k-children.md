# [2226. Maximum Candies Allocated to K Children](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-candies-allocated-to-k-children/description/)

```js
X, X, X, X, X
X, X, X
X, X

kids = 1, 5 = [5]
kids = 2, 3 = [3, 3]
kids = 3, 2 = [2, 2, 2]
```


## Binary Search
There are some key constraints in the problem:
* You can divide each pile into any number of sub piles, but you cannot merge two piles together. 
```js
candies = [6, 8]
           ^
// We can take `6` to one child or `3 + 3` to two children.
// But we can't take `6 + 8` to one child by merging two piles.
```
* Each child gets the same number of candies. 
* Each child can take at most one pile of candies and some piles of candies may go unused. `[8] = [3][3]` to two children (`2` are unsed), it can't be `[3][3][2]` to 3 children.

----
For candies `[2, 5]`, and `k = 2` children:
```js
candies = 1 if [1 | 1]       // valid
candies = 2 if [2 | 2, 2]    // valid, maximum
candies = 3 if [X | 3]       // invalid
candies = 4 if [X | 4]       // invalid
candies = 5 if [X | 5]       // invalid
candies = 6 if [X | X]       // invalid
```

* When `k == 1`, we distribute `max(candies)` to the child.
* When `k == sum(candies)`, we distribute only `1` to each child.
* When `k` is more than total candies, we distirbute `0`, (can't distribute any candy), since every child must get the same number of candies, it can't be some get candy but some dont'.

So the possible answer must be in the range `[0, max(candies)]`.

As the above example, if we can allocate `x` candies to `k` children, we can allocate `x - 1`, `x - 2`, ... candies to `k` children. If we can't allocate `x` candies to `k` children, we can't allocate `x + 1`, `x + 2`, ... candies to `k` children. This exhibits the **monotonicity** characteristic.

* If `x` is feasible, all values `< x` are also feasible.
* If `x` is too large, we cannot distribute to `k` children.
* If `x` is small enough, we can distribute successfully.

```js
[O, O, O, O, X, X, X, ...]
          ^
          The maximum candies we can allocate to k children
```

So we can use binary search to find the maximum candies we can allocate to `<= k` children.

> - Why allowing `< k` children at some amount? It's allowed becase we can increase the amount until we reach the maximum candies we can allocate to `k` children. The more candies we allocate, the less children we can allocate to, that's why `< k` is also acceptable.
> - 我们令每个孩子可以分得的糖果数目记做x。如果x很大，意味着我们可以构造的、符合条件（即每堆恰有x个糖果）的堆数会变少，极有可能最终不够k堆。反之，如果x很小，意味着我们可以构造出更多的、符合条件的堆数，甚至超过k堆，导致这个答案不够优秀。所以我们可以通过二分搜索尝试不同的x的值，来逼近最大的x，使得构造出的堆数恰好大于等于k。([Source](https://github.com/wisdompeak/LeetCode/tree/master/Binary_Search/2226.Maximum-Candies-Allocated-to-K-Children))
> - 這題我們可以先不用理會實際 `k` 的值是多少，我們要看說不同的 `k` 對於答案的影響為何：只有一個小孩、超多小孩使得糖果不夠分...等，最後建構出搜尋範圍和單調性。

```kotlin
fun maximumCandies(candies: IntArray, k: Long): Int {
    var max = Int.MIN_VALUE
    for (c in candies) {
        max = maxOf(max, c)
    }

    // Pay attention to the lower bound, 0 is acceptable answer but we can't used 
    // in binary search because it leads to the error divided by 0 when calculating
    // the children count.
    var left = 1 
    var right = max
    while (left <= right) {
        val middle = left + (right - left) / 2
        if (canAllocated(candies, k, middle)) {
            left = middle + 1
        } else {
            right = middle - 1
        }
    }
    // right will become 0 if there is no candies to distribute.
    //   X X X X X
    // ^ right
    return right
}

private fun canAllocated(candies: IntArray, k: Long, value: Int): Boolean {
    var children = 0L
    for (c in candies) {
        children += (c / value).toLong()
    }
    return k <= children
}
```

* **Time Complexity:** `O(n * log(max(candies)))`, where `n` is the size of the candies array.
* **Space Complexity:** `O(1)`.
