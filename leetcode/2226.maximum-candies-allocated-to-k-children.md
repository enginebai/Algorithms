# [2226. Maximum Candies Allocated to K Children](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-candies-allocated-to-k-children/description/)

## Binary Search
For candies `[2, 5]`, and `k` children:
```js
k = 1, answer = 1 ~ 5   [5]     // remaining [0, 5]
k = 2, answer = 1 ~ 2   [2 | 2] // remaining [0, 3]
k = 3,
answer = 1 if [1 | 1]           // remaining [1, 4], we can
answer = 2 if [2 | 2, 2]        // remaining [0, 1], we can
answer = 3 if []                // remaining [2, 5], we can't allocate 3 candies to 3 children
```

For `k = 1`, we can't allocate candies more than 5 to 1 child. For `k = 3`, we can't allocate candies more than 2 to 3 children. So the maximum candies we can allocate to `k` children is the maximum value in the candies array.

* The minimum candies we can allocate to `k` children is 1.
* The maximum candies we can allocate to `k` children is the maximum value in the candies array.

* Monotonocity: As we can't allocate `x` candies to `k` children, we can't allocate `x + 1`, `x + 2`, ... candies to `k` children. If we can allocate `x` candies to `k` children, we can allocate `x - 1`, `x - 2`, ... candies to `k` children.

```js
[O, O, O, O, X, X, X, ...]
          ^
          The maximum candies we can allocate to k children
```

So we can use binary search to find the maximum candies we can allocate to `k` children.

```kotlin
fun maximumCandies(candies: IntArray, k: Long): Int {
    var max = Int.MIN_VALUE
    for (c in candies) {
        max = maxOf(max, c)
    }

    var left = 1
    var right = max
    while (left <= right) {
        val middle = left + (right - left) / 2
        if (canAllocated(candies, k, middle)) {
            left = middle + 1
        } else {
            right = middle - 1
        }
    }
    // X, X, X
    return right
}

private fun canAllocated(candies: IntArray, k: Long, value: Int): Boolean {
    var children = 0L
    for (c in candies) {
        children += (c / value).toLong()
    }
    return k <= children
}
```

* **Time Complexity:** `O(n * log(max(candies)))`, where `n` is the size of the candies array.
* **Space Complexity:** `O(1)`.
