# [624. Maximum Distance in Arrays](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-distance-in-arrays/description/)

## Enumeration
The distance between `a` and `b` is `|a - b|`. We are given a list of **sorted arrays**, and we need to choose one element from each of two **different** array so that the distance of that two elements is maximized.

The maximum distance is `|a - b|` that is either `max(a) - min(b)` or `max(b) - min(a)`. If we have two arrays only, the maximum distance can be calculated as:

```js
arrays = [
    [3, 5, 7],
    [0, 2, 4]
]
```

* The maximum from one array, the minimum from another array: `|7 - 0| = 7`
* The minimum from one array, the maximum from another array: `|3 - 4| = 1`

For sorted arrays, we only card about:
* It's minimum: `arrays[i].first()`
* It's maximum: `arrays[i].last()`

We can keep track of the maximum and minimum we have seen so far (`globalMin` and `globalMax`), and then iterate through the arrays as another minimum and maximum (`currentMin` and `currentMax`) to find the maximum distance, that is:
* `|globalMax - currentMin|`
* `|globalMin - currentMax|`

We keep track of the maximum and minimum seen so far at the same time so that we will never use they from the same array.

```js
X, X, X, X, X, X, ...
---------|  
   *                globalMax
      *             globalMin
X, X, X, X, X, X, ...
            i
            *       currentMax
            *       currentMin
```

```kotlin
fun maxDistance(arrays: List<List<Int>>): Int {
    var maxDistance = Int.MIN_VALUE
    val n = arrays.size

    // The max and min we have seen so far
    var globalMin = arrays.first().first()
    var globalMax = arrays.first().last()

    for (i in 1 until n) {
        // The max and min from another array
        val currentMin = arrays[i].first()
        val currentMax = arrays[i].last()

        maxDistance = maxOf(maxDistance, abs(currentMin - globalMax))
        maxDistance = maxOf(maxDistance, abs(currentMax - globalMin))

        globalMin = minOf(globalMin, currentMin)
        globalMax = maxOf(globalMax, currentMax)
    }
    return maxDistance
}
```

### Dry Run
```js
arrays = [
    [3, 5, 7],
    [0, 2, 4],
    [1, 3, 5]
]

// Initialization
globalMin = 3
globalMax = 7
maxDistance = -oo

// First iteration, i = 1
currentMin = 0
currentMax = 4
maxDistance = max(maxDistance, abs(0 - 7), abs(4 - 3)) = max(-oo, 7, 1) = 7
globalMin = min(3, 0) = 0
globalMax = max(7, 4) = 7

// Second iteration, i = 2
currentMin = 1
currentMax = 5
maxDistance = max(maxDistance, abs(1 - 7), abs(5 - 0)) = max(7, 6, 5) = 7
globalMin = min(0, 1) = 0
globalMax = max(7, 5) = 7
