# [916. Word Subsets](https://leetcode.com/problems/word-subsets/description/)

## Hash Table
We add `word1[i]` if every word in `word2` exists in it. But we don't need to check every character in `word2` for every word in `word1`. 

```js
word1 = ["aaaaaaaa", ...]
word2 = ["aaa", "aaaa", "a"]
```

We don't check `"aaa"`, `"aaaa"`, `"a"` for every word in `word1`. We just **merge** them into a single word and check if every character in this merged word exists in `word1`. We can only **check the maximum frequency** of each character in `word2` and then check if it exists in `word1`.

For example, for `["aaa", "aaaa", "a"]`, we only need to check if `word1` contains `max(3, 4, 1) = 4` `a's`.

```kotlin
fun wordSubsets(words1: Array<String>, words2: Array<String>): List<String> {
    val n = words2.size
    val count2 = IntArray(26)
    for (i in words2.indices) {
        val word = words2[i]
        val currentCount = IntArray(26)
        for (c in word) {
            currentCount[c - 'a']++
        }
        for (i in 0 until 26) {
            count2[i] = maxOf(count2[i], currentCount[i])
        }
    }
    val universal = mutableListOf<String>()
    for (word in words1) {
        val count1 = IntArray(26)
        for (c in word) {
            count1[c - 'a']++
        }

        if (isSubset(count1, count2)) {
            universal.add(word)
        }
    }
    return universal
}

private fun isSubset(a: IntArray, b: IntArray): Boolean {
    for (i in 0 until 26) {
        if (a[i] < b[i]) return false
    }
    return true
}
```

* **Time Complexity:** `O(N + M)`, where N is the total number of characters in `words2` and M is the total number of characters in `words1`.
* **Space Complexity:** `O(1)`. We use a constant space for the two arrays of size 26.
