# [1423. Maximum Points You Can Obtain from Cards](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-points-you-can-obtain-from-cards/description/)

## Sliding Window
We can take one card from left and right, but we don't know which side is better. So we can take `0..k` cards from left and `k..0` cards from right, then we can get the maximum points.

```js
[2,7,8,...,5,1,6], k = 3
 X         _,_,_    // (0,k)
 _           _,_    // (1,k-1)
 _,_           _    // (2,k-2)
 _,_,_         X    // (3,k-3)
                    // Find the maximum among them
```

Why don't we take the maximum card from left or right immediately? (Greedy) Because we're not sure if we can get the maximum points by taking the maximum card from one side. We need to try both sides. See `[3, 7, ..., 1, 5], k = 2`, if we take `5` first from right, it doesn't lead to the maximum points because we can take `[3, 7]` from left only.

We take `k` cards from left or right, then **it remains `n - k` continuous cards**. We can calculate the sum of `0..k` from left and `k..0` from right, then we can get the maximum points by subtracting the sum of the remaining `n - k` cards from the total sum. 

```js
k=3
0 1 2 3 4 5
|---| O O O // sum(3..5) = total - sum(0..2)    
O |---| O O // sum(2..4) = total - sum(0..1)
O O |---| O // sum(1..5) = total - sum(0..0)
O O O |---| // sum(0..4) = total - sum(1..5)
```

Then this is a fixed size sliding window problem:

> Or it finds the minimum of `n - k` slinding window.

```kotlin
fun maxScore(cardPoints: IntArray, k: Int): Int {
    val n = cardPoints.size
    var totalSum = 0
    for (p in cardPoints) {
        totalSum += p
    }
    var sum = 0
    var maxScore = 0
    // We will subtract the sum of the window from the total sum
    val windowSize = n - k
    for (i in cardPoints.indices) {
        sum += cardPoints[i]
        if (i >= windowSize) {
            sum -= cardPoints[i - windowSize]
        }
        if (i >= windowSize - 1) {
            maxScore = maxOf(maxScore, totalSum - sum)
        }
    }
    return maxScore
}
```
