# [841. Keys and Rooms](https://leetcode.com/problems/keys-and-rooms/)

## Clarification Questions
* Does the input list of rooms contain duplicate keys?
 
## Test Cases
### Normal Cases
* All rooms are visited.
* Not all rooms are visited.

### Edge / Corner Cases
* There are keys to all rooms except the first room.

## Travesal
We can use either DFS or BFS to traverse to get the keys from room 0, and then try to visit all the rooms.
* Start from room 0 and keep track of the visited rooms.
* Get the keys from the current room and visit the rooms the keys can open.
* Iterate the visited rooms to see if all rooms are visited.

```kotlin
fun canVisitAllRooms(rooms: List<List<Int>>): Boolean {
    val n = rooms.size
    val visited = HashSet<Int>()
    // dfs(rooms, 0, visited)
    bfs(rooms, visited)
    for (i in 0 until n) {
        if (!visited.contains(i)) return false
    }
    return true
}

// Time complexity: O(n + e)
// Space complexity: O(n): visited and recursive call stack, as the recursion goes as deep as the number of roooms.
private fun dfs(rooms: List<List<Int>>, current: Int, visited: HashSet<Int>) {
    if (visited.contains(current)) return
    visited.add(current)

    rooms[current].forEach { adj ->
        dfs(rooms, adj, visited)
    }
}

// Time complexity: O(n + e)
// Space complexity: O(n): visited
private fun bfs(rooms: List<List<Int>>, visited: HashSet<Int>) {
    val queue = ArrayDeque<Int>()
    queue.addLast(0)
    while (queue.isNotEmpty()) {
        val node = queue.removeFirst()

        if (visited.contains(node)) continue
        visited.add(node)

        rooms[node].forEach { adj -> 
            queue.addLast(adj)
        }
    }
}
```

* **Time Complexity**: `O(n + e)`, where n is the number of rooms and e is the number of keys.
* **Space Complexity**: `O(n)`, where n is the number of rooms.
