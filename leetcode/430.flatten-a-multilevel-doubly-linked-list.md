# [430. Flatten a Multilevel Doubly Linked List](https://leetcode.com/problems/flatten-a-multilevel-doubly-linked-list/)

## Hints
1. Think about how this problem is similar to flattening a tree
2. What traversal order would help you process nodes in the correct sequence?
3. Consider how to handle the connections between different levels

## Breakdowns
1. First, understand what "flattening" means:
   - All nodes should be in a single level
   - Child pointers should be nullified
   - Nodes from child lists should be inserted between current node and next node

2. For each node:
   - Process current node
   - Handle its child list (if exists)
   - Handle its next node
   - Fix all prev/next pointers

## Key Insights
For each `root`, when flattening:
* `child` is flattened first. 
* Then the flattened child list should come before `next`.

**Idea!!** It's like a tree preorder traversal, we just relink the nodes during traversal.

Example visualization:
```js
1 -> 5 -> ...
|
2 -> 3 -> 4

flatten(1) = 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> ...
```

## Recursive
The key idea is to use DFS to process nodes in preorder fashion, where we flatten child list first before connecting it with the next nodes.

```js
current -> next
   |
 child -> ...
   |
  ...

// Start flattening from current node.
current -> f(next)
   |
 f(child) -> ...
   |
  ...

flatten(current) =
current -> f(child) -> f(next)

// And so on...

// Example:
2 -> 3
|
5 -> 6
|
7 -> 8 -> 9

f(2) =
2 -> f(5) -> f(3)

f(5) =
5 -> f(7) -> f(6)

// Backtracking...
f(7) = 7 -> 8 -> 9
f(5) = 5 -> 7 -> 8 -> 9 -> f(6)
```

```kotlin
fun flatten(root: Node?): Node? {
    if (root == null) return null
    val next = root.next
    val prev = root.prev
    val child = root.child

    val flattenedNext = flatten(next)
    if (child != null) {
        val flattenedChild = flatten(child)
        root?.child = null

        // Connect the last node of the child list to the next node.
        // See f(5) = 5 -> 7 -> 8 -> 9 -> 6, we need to connect 9 to 6.
        var last = flattenedChild
        while (last?.next != null) {
            last = last.next
        }
        last?.next = flattenedNext
        flattenedNext?.prev = last

        root.next = flattenedChild
        flattenedChild?.prev = root
    }
    return root
}
```

- **Time Complexity**: `O(N)` where `N` is the total number of nodes
- **Space Complexity**: `O(H)` where `H` is the maximum depth of the multilevel structure (recursion stack)

## Iterative
The key idea is to use a stack to simulate the recursive process, pushing next and child nodes in reverse order to maintain proper sequence.

> 迭代就是一層一層移上來，節點有 child 就先往 stack 送，等遍歷完子節點後再從棧取出回朔。

```kotlin
fun flatten(root: Node?): Node? {
    if (root == null) return null
    val sentinel = Node(-1)
    var current = sentinel
    val stack = Stack<Node>()
    stack.push(root)
    while (stack.isNotEmpty()) {
        val node = stack.pop()
        current.next = node
        node.prev = current

        if (node.next != null) {
            stack.push(node.next)
        }
        if (node.child != null) {
            stack.push(node.child)
            node.child = null
        }
        current = current.next!!
    }
    /**
     * Remember to remove the sentinel node.
     * The real `prev` of the first node should be null, but we 
     * will update it while iterating:
     * ```
     * current.next = node
     * node.prev = current
     * ```
     * After flattening, the list looks like:
     * `sentinel <- -> flattened list`
     * so we have to "reset" it.
     */
    sentinel.next?.prev = null
    return sentinel.next
}
```

- **Time Complexity**: `O(N)` where `N` is the total number of nodes
- **Space Complexity**: `O(N)` in worst case when all nodes are in child lists

## In-place
The key idea is to flatten one child level by level, and then connect it with the next level.
```js
current -> next -> ...
    |
 child 1 -> next 1 -> ... tail 1
    |
 child 2 -> next 2 -> ... tail 2

// Flatten child 1
current -> child 1 -> next 1 ->  ... tail 1 -> next -> ...
           ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ // child 1 is flattened
             |
           child 2 -> next 2 -> ... tail 2

// We move `current` to `current.next`, which is `child 1`:
current -> child 1 (new current) -> ...
             |
           child 2 -> next 2 -> ... tail 2

// Flatten child 2
current -> child 1  -> child 2 -> next 2 -> ... tail 2 -> next 1 -> ... tail 1 -> next -> ...
                       ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ // child 2 is flattened
```

```kotlin
fun flatten(root: Node?): Node? {
    var current = root
    while (current != null) {
        if (current.child != null) {
            val next = current.next

            val child = current.child!!
            current.next = child
            child.prev = current
            current.child = null

            var tail = current!!
            while (tail.next != null) {
                tail = tail.next!!
            }

            tail.next = next
            next?.prev = tail
        }
        // current.next is the new node after flattening, which is the child node if it exists or the next node otherwise.
        current = current.next
    }
    return root
}
```

- **Time Complexity**: `O(N)` where `N` is the total number of nodes
- **Space Complexity**: `O(1)`

## Edge Cases
1. Single node with no `child`
2. Node with `child` but no `next`
3. Node with both `child` and `next`
4. Multiple levels of children

Visual examples for tricky edge cases:
```js
// Case 2: Node with child but no next
1
|
2 -> 3
     |
     4
// Should become: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4

// Case 3: Node with both child and next
1 -> 2 -> 3
|
4 -> 5
     |
     6
// Should become: 1 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6 -> 2 -> 3

// Case 4: Multiple levels of children
1 -> 2
|
3
|
4 -> 5
     |
     6
// Should become: 1 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6 -> 2
```

## Pitfalls
1. Forgetting to nullify child pointers after flattening
2. Not properly handling prev pointers when connecting lists
