# [861. Score After Flipping Matrix](https://leetcode.com/problems/score-after-flipping-matrix/description/)

## Greedy
The value of each row represents an integer in binary, we can flip the row or column in any order and any number of times. The goal is to maximize the sum of the integers represented by each row. How can we maximize the sum? Maximize the number of `1`'s which are as left as possible.

Flipping the row will affect the entire row, the represented integer will change significantly, while flipping the column will only affect one bit the column itself, the represented integer will change slightly. We should flip the row first, then flip the column to maximize the sum bit by bit.

When should we flip the row? We have to ensure the first bit in the row is always 1 to maximize the integer, because the bit in higher-order position leads to larger integer. We should flip the row if the first bit is 0, because `1000` is always greater than `0111`.

After flipping the row, we can flip the column if it contains more `0`'s than `1`'s in the column, the number of `1`'s at the same bit increases, the total sum would increase as well.

```kotlin
fun matrixScore(grid: Array<IntArray>): Int {
    val m = grid.size
    val n = grid[0].size

    // Flip the row if the first bit is 0
    for (row in 0 until m) {
        var flip = grid[row][0] == 0
        if (flip) {
            for (col in 0 until n) {
                grid[row][col] = original.flip()
            }
        }
    }

    // Flip the column if it contains more 0's than 1's
    for (col in 0 until n) {
        var count0 = 0
        for (row in 0 until m) {
            if (grid[row][col] == 0) count0++
        }

        if (m - count0 < count0) {
            for (row in 0 until m) {
                grid[row][col] = grid[row][col].flip()
            }
        }
    }
    var sum = 0
    for (row in 0 until m) {
        sum += grid[row].binaryToInt()
    }
    return sum
}

private fun Int.flip() = if (this == 0) 1 else 0

private fun IntArray.binaryToInt(): Int {
    var num = 0
    for (bit in this) {
        num = num * 2 + bit
    }
    return num
}
```

* **Time Complexity:** `O(m * n)`, `m` is the number of rows, `n` is the number of columns.
* **Space Complexity:** `O(1)`.
