We can break the profit by day, if the price of today is greater than previous day, then there will be some profit.

```kotlin
fun maxProfit(prices: IntArray): Int {
    var profit = 0
    for (i in 1 until prices.size) {
        if (prices[i] > prices[i - 1]) {
            profit += prices[i] - prices[i - 1]
        }
    }
    return profit
}
```
