# [3319. K-th Largest Perfect Subtree Size in Binary Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/k-th-largest-perfect-subtree-size-in-binary-tree/description/)

## Bottom-Up DFS + Heap
We can use the bottom-up DFS similar to [110. Balanced Binary Tree](../leetcode/110.balanced-binary-tree.md) to calculate the depth of each node:

- We calculate the depth of subtree recursively.
- If the subtree is a perfect subtree, then we have to ensure the current root is also a perfect tree.
    - The depth of all the subtrees should be the same.
    - The number of nodes in the subtree should be `2^n - 1`, where `n` is the depth.
- Otherwise, if there is a subtree that is not a perfect subtree, we return `-1` to indicate the node is not a perfect subtree.
```js
     node          node
   /      \      /      \
  2        1    -1       1
```

Then we use a fixed-size `k` min heap to store the size of the perfect subtree so that we can get the `k`th largest perfect subtree size.

> We can also use number of nodes to determine if the subtree is a perfect subtree.

```kotlin
fun kthLargestPerfectSubtree(root: TreeNode?, k: Int): Int {
    val minHeap = PriorityQueue<Int>()
    dfs(root, minHeap, k)
    return if (minHeap.size == k) minHeap.peek() else -1
}

// Return the depth
private fun dfs(root: TreeNode?, minHeap: PriorityQueue<Int>, k: Int): Int {
    if (root == null) return 0
    val left = dfs(root.left, minHeap, k)
    val right = dfs(root.right, minHeap, k)

    if (left != -1 && right != -1) {
        if (left == right) {
            // number of nodes are 2^n - 1, where `n` is the depth
            val depth = left + 1
            val nodesCount = Math.pow(2.0, depth.toDouble()).toInt() - 1
            minHeap.add(nodesCount, k)
            return depth
        }
    }
    return -1
}

private fun PriorityQueue<Int>.add(count: Int, k: Int) {
    this.add(count)
    if (this.size > k) {
        this.poll()
    }
}
```
