## [907. Sum of Subarray Minimums](https://leetcode.com/problems/sum-of-subarray-minimums/)

**Idea!** We will find the smallest number and see how many time does the smallest number contribute to the sum of `min(b)`.

Suppose we have a smallest number `2` in our array `X X X X 2 X X X`, we will find out that how many time does `2` contribute to the sum of `min(b)`. We can keep looking at the left and right hand side until we find the number that is smaller than `2`.

```js
// Search the smaller number from left and right hand side
X X X X 2 X X X
  <-----*----->

// This is the range that the subarray contains 2 and contributes the min(b)
X X 0 3 2 4 5 1 
      |-*---|
```

We will keep looking for the previous and next smaller numbers. (`prevSmaller`, `nextSmaller`).

Then `2` contributes to the sum of `min(b)` from all the subarrays ranging from `[3, 2, 4, 5]` that contains `2`, that is all the subarrays begin from `[3, 2]`, end at `[2, 4, 5]`, so there are 2 * 3 subarrays.

```js
/// The possible start of subarray that contains 2.
[3, 2, _, _]

/// The possible end of subarray that contains 2.
[_, 2, 4, 5]
```

However, we have to mind the case that there are duplicates of smallest number, that is 

```js
2 3 2 4 5 2
<---*--->
```

There are two `2` (leftmost and rightmost), we will stop looking for previous smaller if it's the duplicate of smallest number, but we won't stop for next smaller.

```kotlin
private val mod = 1000000000 + 7

fun sumSubarrayMins(arr: IntArray): Int {
    val n = arr.size
    // Index, we have to provide the default value to indicate not found
    val nextSmaller = IntArray(n) { n }
    val prevSmaller = IntArray(n) { -1 }

    // Index, we have to calculate the length of subarray
    val stack = Stack<Int>()
    for (i in 0 until n) {
        while (stack.isNotEmpty() && arr[stack.peek()] > arr[i]) {
            val index = stack.pop()
            nextSmaller[index] = i
        }
        stack.push(i)
    }
    stack.clear()
    for (i in n -1 downTo 0) {
        // There is "equal" operator, for preventing the duplicate of previous smaller.
        while (stack.isNotEmpty() && arr[stack.peek()] >= arr[i]) {
            val index = stack.pop()
            prevSmaller[index] = i
        }
        stack.push(i)
    }

    // Use Long type to prevent overflow
    var result = 0L
    for (i in 0 until n) {
        val sum: Long = arr[i].toLong() * (nextSmaller[i] - i).toLong() % mod * (i - prevSmaller[i]) % mod
        result = (result + sum) % mod
    }
    return result.toInt()
}
