# [1052. Grumpy Bookstore Owner](https://leetcode.com/problems/grumpy-bookstore-owner/)

## Sliding Window
We sum up the customers who are satisfied without the owner being grumpy, and then we use a fixed-size (`minutes`) sliding window to find the maximum number of customers who are satisfied with the owner being grumpy.

Please note that the window keeps track of the number of customers who are satisfied with the owner being grumpy.

```js

index     0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7
customer: 1, 0, 1, 2, 1, 1, 7, 5
grumpy:   0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1
base:     1,    1,    1,    7
extra:    ^^^^^^^^ ->
maxExtra:                1,    5
```

```kotlin
fun maxSatisfied(customers: IntArray, grumpy: IntArray, minutes: Int): Int {
    val n = customers.size
    var base = 0
    var extra = 0
    var maxExtra = 0
    for (i in customers.indices) {
        if (grumpy[i] == 0) {
            base += customers[i]
        }
        else {
            extra += customers[i]
        }

        if (i >= minutes && grumpy[i - minutes] == 1) {
            extra -= customers[i - minutes]
        }
        if (i >= minutes - 1) {
            maxExtra = max(maxExtra, extra)
        }
    }
    return base + maxExtra
}
```

## Pitfalls
- Forgetting checking if `grumpy[i - minutes] == 1` when shrinking `extra`.
- Mixing up base satisfaction vs extra.
