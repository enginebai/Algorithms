# [35. Search Insert Position](https://leetcode.com/problems/search-insert-position/)

## Clarification Questions
* Is the array empty?
* Contain duplicates?
 
## Test Cases
### Normal Cases
```
Input: nums = [1,3,5,7], target = 5
Output: 2

Input: nums = [1,3,5,7], target = 6
Output: 1
```

### Edge / Corner Cases
* The target is smaller than the first element.
```
Input: nums = [1,3,5,7], target = 0
Output: 0
```

* The target is larger than the last element.
```
Input: nums = [1,3,5,7], target = 8
Output: 5
```

## Binary Search
To find the target value or the index to insert, then it indicates that we're going to search **the smallest number which is equals to or greater than `target`** (it's *"floor", "left bound"*).

```js
[1, 3, 5, 6], target = 5
       ^ // target position

[1, 3, 5, 6], target = 2
    ^ // Insert position, 3 is the smallest number which is equals to or greater than 2.
```
> How about `the largest number which is equals to or smaller than target`? No, it's not the correct insertion position. From the example `[1, 3, 5, 6], target = 2`, the correct insertion position is at value `3`, not `1`.

How can we find the smallest number which is equals to or greater than `target`? For the normal binary search, we have the following conditions:
* If `target < nums[middle]`, we should search the left part. (The normal binary search condition)
* If `nums[middle] < target`, we should search the right part. (The normal binary search condition)
* If `target == nums[middle]`, the critial part is here, we should search the left part, because we are not sure if the `middle` is the smallest number >= `target`, so we keep searching the left part.

> This approach is also applicable to the array with duplicates.
>
> The `left` pointer is the index of the smallest number >= `target`, and the `right` pointer is the index of the largest number <= `target`. For more explanation detail regarding the return value `left` index, you can check below.

```kotlin
fun searchInsert(nums: IntArray, target: Int): Int {
    var left = 0
    var right = nums.size - 1
    while (left <= right) {
        val middle = left + (right - left) / 2
        if (target < nums[middle]) right = middle - 1       // Normal binary search condition
        else if (nums[middle] < target) left = middle + 1   // Normal binary search condition
        else if (target == nums[middle]) right = middle - 1 // The critical part, we should search the left part.
    }
    // Why returning left? See below explanation.
    // The possible range is `[0, size]`
    return left
}

// Or equivalently
fun searchInsert(nums: IntArray, target: Int): Int {
    var left = 0
    var right = nums.size - 1
    
    while (left <= right) {
        val middle = left + (right - left) / 2

        // As same as normal binary search.
        if (nums[middle] == target) return middle
        else if (nums[middle] < target) {
            left = middle + 1
        } else if (target < nums[middle]) {
            right = middle - 1
        }
    }
    return left
}
```

### Why Returning `left` at the End?
As we have `while (left <= right)`, in the last iteration we have the following cases:
#### Case 1. `left == middle == right`
When size is odd, or simply size is 1:
```js
[..., X, ...]
      L
      M
      R
```
* If `target <= nums[middle]`, then `middle` should be the correct answer and we should search left part by moving `right = middle - 1`. At the moment, the while loop terminates, `left` is at the same position of `middle`, so it is the correct answer.
```js
......., X, M, ...
target      L
         R
```
* If `nums[middle] < target`, `middle + 1` should be the correct answer, and we should search right part by moving `left = middle + 1`. At the moment, the while loop terminates, `left` is the correct answer.

```js
..., M, X, ...
        L   target
     R
```

#### Case 2. `left == middle = right - 1`
When size is even, or simply size is 2:
```js
[..., X, X, ...]
      L  R
      M 
```
* If `target <= nums[middle]`: `middle` is the correct answer, as same as case 1.
* If `nums[middle] < target`: We should search right part, we move `left = middle + 1` which is equal to `right`, then it becomes the case `left == middle == right`, and we have already explained the logic above.

## Alternative Thinking
**Another Important Idea!!** 

Or you can think in this way, **we are looking for the first element that satifies the condition `target <= num`, our condition is `target <= num`**. and we have the following array, `X` indicates the numbers that doesn't meet the condition (the numbers < `target`), and `O` indicate the number met the condition (the numbers >= `target`), then the smallest number which is equals to or greater than `target` is the first `O` we want:
```js
[X, X, X, O, O, O, O]
          ^ // target
 L                 R
```

It's similar to [First Bad Version](../leetcode/278.first-bad-version.md).

```kotlin
fun searchInsert(nums: IntArray, target: Int): Int {
    var left = 0
    var right = nums.size - 1
    while (left <= right) {
        val middle = left + (right - left) / 2
        // Looking for the first element that satifies the condition.
        if (meetCondition(target, nums[middle])) {
            right = middle - 1
        } else {
            left = middle + 1
        }
    }
    return left
}

// Condition: target <= num
private fun meetCondition(target: Int, num: Int): Boolean {
    return target <= num
}
```

### Possible `left` Range
The `left` pointer is in the range `[0, size]`:
```js
[O, O, O, O]
 ^ // Not found

[X, X, O, O]
       ^ // target

[X, X, X, X], n
              ^ // target 
```

### Example
> Try the example with only 2 element.
```js
 Position: 0, 1
 Array:   [7, 9]
 3 => [*3, 7, 9]  0 // The result will be 0 if target is smaller than the first element.
 7 => [*7, 7, 9]  0
 8 => [7, *8, 9]  1
 9 => [7, *9, 9]  1
10 => [7, 9, *10] 2 // The result will be `size` if target is larger than the last element.
^                 ^
Target            Insert Position
```

## Bonus
How to find the last element which is <= `target` (It' *"ceiling" or "right bound"*, not the insert position)? 

It's the pattern:
```js
[O, O, O, X, X, X, X]
       ^ // target
```
We search the last element that satisfies the condition `num <= target`.

### Possible `right` Range
The `right` pointer is in the range `[-1, size - 1]`:

```js
// Possible range, determinicis
_, [X, X, X, X]
^ // Not found

[X, X, O, O]
          ^ // target

[O, O, O, O]
          ^ // target
```

### Example
```js
[1, 3, 7] target = 5
 O  O  X
    ^

[1, 3, 3, 3] target = 3
 O  O  O  O
          ^

-1 [7, 7, 7] target = 5 // return -1
    X  X  X
 ^
    L
    M
 R

[1, 1, 1] target = 5
 O  O  O
       ^
          L
       M
       R
```

```kotlin
fun search(nums: IntArray, target: Int): Int {
    var left = 0
    var right = nums.size - 1
    
    while (left <= right) {
        val middle = left + (right - left) / 2

        if (target < nums[middle]) {
            right = middle - 1
        } else if (target == nums[middle]) { // We are not sure if it's the last element, so we keep searching the right part.
            left = middle + 1
        } else if (nums[middle] < target) {
            left = middle + 1
        }
    }
    return right
}

// Or equivalently, we search the last element that satisfies the condition `num <= target`.
fun search(nums: IntArray, target: Int): Int {
    var left = 0
    var right = nums.size - 1
    
    while (left <= right) {
        val middle = left + (right - left) / 2

        // Looking for the last element that satisfies the condition.
        if (meetCondition(target, nums[middle])) {
            left = middle + 1
        } else {
            right = middle - 1
        }
    }
    // The possible range is `[-1, size - 1]`
    return right
}

// Condition: num <= target
private fun meetCondition(target: Int, num: Int): Boolean {
    return num <= target
}
```
