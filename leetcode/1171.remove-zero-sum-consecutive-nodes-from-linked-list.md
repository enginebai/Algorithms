# [1171. Remove Zero Sum Consecutive Nodes from Linked List](https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-zero-sum-consecutive-nodes-from-linked-list/description/)

## Hints
- Think about how to efficiently track the sum of sublists.
- Consider using a hash table to store prefix sums.
- What happens when you encounter the same prefix sum twice?

## Prefix Sum + Hash Table (One Pass)
`pre[j] - pre[i] = sum of list from i + 1 to j`. If `pre[j] == pre[i]`, then `sum of list from i + 1 to j = 0`.

The key idea is to use prefix sums to track cumulative sums and a hash table to store the first occurrence of each prefix sum. When we encounter the same prefix sum again, we can remove the sublist between these points.

There are a few things to note:
- Using a sentinel node makes it easier to handle edge cases where we need to remove nodes from the beginning.
- We need to clean up the hash table when removing nodes to maintain correctness. (See below) When we iterate the last `-1`, the prefix sum is `3` which exists in the map. So we relink the node and have to clean up the key between previous `3` and current `3`, that are `6, 5, 4`, the intermediate nodes are removed, so we have to remove themy from the map as well.

```js
1 -> 2 -> 3 -> -1 -> -1 -> -1 -> -2
1 -> 3 -> 6 ->  5 ->  4 ->  3
     |----------------------|
                            * 3 exists in map
1 -> 2 -> ___________________ -> -2
```

```kotlin
fun removeZeroSumSublists(head: ListNode?): ListNode? {
    val sentinel = ListNode(-1)
    sentinel.next = head
    val map = HashMap<Int, ListNode>()
    var prefixSum = 0
    var current = head
    map[0] = sentinel
    while (current != null) {
        prefixSum += current.`val`
        val next = current.next
        if (prefixSum in map) {
            // Found a zero-sum sublist
            val previous = map[prefixSum]!!
            
            // Clean up all intermediate prefix sums from the map
            // to avoid incorrect references in future iterations
            var tempNode = previous.next
            var tempSum = prefixSum
            while (tempNode != current) {
                tempSum += tempNode!!.`val`
                map.remove(tempSum)
                tempNode = tempNode.next
            }
            
            // Skip the zero-sum sublist
            previous.next = next
        } else {
            map[prefixSum] = current
        }
        current = next
    }
    return sentinel.next
}
```

- **Time Complexity**: `O(N)`, where `N` is the number of nodes. Each node is visited and processed once.
- **Space Complexity**: `O(N)` for the hash table to store prefix sums.

## Prefix Sum + Hash Table (Two Pass)
An alternative approach is to first calculate all prefix sums and store them in a hash table, then make a second pass to remove the zero-sum sublists. This approach is more straightforward but requires two passes through the list.

```kotlin
fun removeZeroSumSublists(head: ListNode?): ListNode? {
    // Create a sentinel node to handle edge cases like removing the head
    val sentinel = ListNode(-1)
    sentinel.next = head
    // Map to store prefix sums and their corresponding nodes
    val map = HashMap<Int, ListNode>()
    var prefixSum = 0
    var current = sentinel
    
    /**
     * First pass: Calculate prefix sums and store the last occurrence of each sum.
     * If we encounter the same prefix sum multiple times, we overwrite the previous entry.
     * This effectively remembers only the last node with each prefix sum.
     * 
     * Why do we remember only the last occurrence of each prefix sum?
     * This is crucial because when we find a prefix sum that we've seen before,
     * it means all nodes between the previous occurrence and current node sum to zero.
     * By keeping only the last occurrence, we can later connect nodes to skip all
     * zero-sum sublists in a single operation during the second pass.
     * 
     * For example, if we have: 1->2->-3->3->1 with prefix sums [0,1,3,0,3,4]
     * When we see prefix sum 3 again at node(3), we overwrite the entry for 3,
     * allowing us to later skip the zero-sum segment 2->-3 in the second pass.
     */
    while (current != null) {
        prefixSum += current.`val`
        map[prefixSum] = current
        current = current.next
    }
    
    // Second pass: Remove zero-sum sublists
    prefixSum = 0
    // We start from the sentinel, so that we can handle the case where the entire list sums to 0
    current = sentinel
    while (current != null) {
        prefixSum += current.`val`
        // The key insight: if we've seen this prefix sum before (stored in the map),
        // then all nodes between the current position and the stored position sum to zero
        // We can skip directly to the node after the last occurrence of this prefix sum
        val nextNode = map[prefixSum]?.next
        current.next = nextNode
        current = current.next
    }
    // Return the head of the modified list (skip the sentinel)
    return sentinel.next
}
```

- **Time Complexity**: `O(N)`, where `N` is the number of nodes. We make two passes through the list.
- **Space Complexity**: `O(N)` for the hash table to store prefix sums.

### Dry Run
For the list: `1 -> 2 -> -3 -> 3 -> 1`:
* First pass: Build `prefixSum → node` map.
| Step | Node Value | Prefix Sum | Map Entry Updated To              |
|------|------------|-------------|-----------------------------------|
| 2    | 1          | 1           | `1 → node(1)`                     |
| 3    | 2          | 3           | `3 → node(2)`                     |
| 4    | -3         | 0           | `0 → node(-3)` (overwrites `0`)   |
| 5    | 3          | 3           | `3 → node(3)` (overwrites `3`)    |
| 6    | 1          | 4           | `4 → node(1)`                     |

* Final `prefixMap` after first pass:
```js
{
    0 → node(-3),
    1 → node(1),
    3 → node(3),
    4 → node(1)
}
```

* Second pass: Remove zero-sum sublists
| Step | Prefix Sum | Found in Map? | `node.next` Becomes                |
|------|------------|---------------|------------------------------------|
| 1    | 0          | Yes → node(-3) | `dummy.next = node(-3).next = node(3)` |
| 2    | 3          | Yes → node(3)  | `node(3).next = node(3).next` (no change) |
| 3    | 4          | Yes → node(1)  | `node(1).next = null`               |

* Final list after second pass: `3 -> 1`

## Edge Cases
1. Empty list
2. Single node with value 0
3. Multiple consecutive zero-sum sublists
4. Zero-sum sublist at the beginning or end
5. All nodes sum to zero

## Pitfalls
1. Forgetting to use a sentinel node can make handling edge cases more complex
2. **Not cleaning up the hash table** when removing nodes can lead to incorrect results
3. Not handling the case where **the entire list sums to zero**
4. Off-by-one errors when removing nodes from the list
