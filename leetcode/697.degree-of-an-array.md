# [697. Degree of an Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/degree-of-an-array/description/)

## Breakdowns
> 1. How to know the maximum frequency? (maybe multiple)

Count the frequency and update the maximum frequency at the same time.

> 2. If I know the current number is the maximum frequency, how to calculate the shortest subarray that contains all the current number?

Suppose `8` is the most frequent number in the input array: `[..., x, 8, x, x, x, 8, x, 8, x, ...]`, we need to know the first and last position of `8`.

> 3. If there are multiple numbers which are the most frequent, how can we track the first and last position of each number?

Use a dictionary to store the first and last position of each number.

## Hash Table
1. Count the frequency of each number, and update the maximum frequency.
2. Use a dictionary to store the first and last position of each number.
3. Calculate the shortest subarray that contains all the most frequent numbers.

```kotlin
fun findShortestSubArray(nums: IntArray): Int {
    val countMap = HashMap<Int, Int>()
    var maxCount = 0
    val first = HashMap<Int, Int>()
    val last = HashMap<Int, Int>()
    for (i in nums.indices) {
        val num = nums[i]
        val count = (countMap[num] ?: 0) + 1 
        countMap[num] = count
        maxCount = maxOf(maxCount, count)

        if (num !in first) {
            first[num] = i
        }
        last[num] = i
    }

    var ans = nums.size
    for (i in nums.indices) {
        val num = nums[i]
        val count = countMap[num] ?: continue
        if (count == maxCount) {
            ans = minOf(ans, last[num]!! - first[num]!! + 1)
        }
    }
    return ans
}
