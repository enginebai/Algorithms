# [1790. Check if One String Swap Can Make Strings Equal](https://leetcode.com/problems/check-if-one-string-swap-can-make-strings-equal/description/)

## Clarification Questions
* What does the string consist of?
 
## Test Cases
### Normal Cases
```
Input: "ab", "ba"
Output: True

Input: "ab", "ab"
Output: True

Input: "aab", "baa"
Output: True
```
### Edge / Corner Cases
```
Input: "aa", "ab"
Output: False

Input: "aay", "baa"
Output: False
```

## Counting
* The occurrence of characters in both strings should be the same. If the occurrence of characters is not the same, then it's not possible to make the strings equal by swapping one character.
* Then the difference between the two strings should be exactly 0 or 2.

```python
def areAlmostEqual(self, s1: str, s2: str) -> bool:
    from collections import Counter
    s1_count = Counter(s1)
    s2_count = Counter(s2)
    diff = 0
    for i in range(len(s1)):
        if s1[i] != s2[i]: diff += 1
    return (diff == 0 or diff == 2) and s1_count == s2_count
```
* **Time Complexity:** `O(n)`, where `n` is the length of the string.
* **Space Complexity:** `O(n)`, for the counter.

## Spaced Optimization
We don't have to count every occurrence of characters in both strings. We can just count the difference between the two strings. There should be no differences or exact 2 differences. If there are exact 2 differences, we should swap the characters to make the two strings equal.

```python
def areAlmostEqual(self, s1: str, s2: str) -> bool:
    diff = []        
    for i in range(len(s1)):
        if s1[i] != s2[i]: diff.append(i)
        if len(diff) > 2: return False
    
    return len(diff) == 0 or 
    (len(diff) == 2 and 
        ((s1[diff[0]] == s2[diff[1]]) and
        (s1[diff[1]] == s2[diff[0]])))
```
* **Time Complexity:** `O(n)`, where `n` is the length of the string.
* **Space Complexity:** `O(1)`. The size of the `diff` array is at most 2.
