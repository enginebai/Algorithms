## [96. Unique Binary Search Trees](https://leetcode.com/problems/unique-binary-search-trees/)

For example `n = 4`, we have `[1, 2, 3, 4]` nodes, we iterate every nodes and use the node as the root, then we count the combination of left and right children.

```js
// Use 1 as root
|1| 
    2, 3, 4 

// Use 2 as root
  |2| 
1     3, 4 

// So on...
```

* When using 1 as root, it becomes 0 node and 3 nodes combination.
* When using 2 as root, it becomes 1 node and 2 nodes combination.
* Using 3 as root, 2 nodes and 1 node combination.
* Using 4 as root, 3 nodes and 0 node combination.

For `n = 4`, we have to iterate from 1 to 4, and summary all the combination count.


```kotlin
fun numTrees(n: Int): Int {
    if (n <= 1) return 1
    val dp = IntArray(n + 1)
    dp[0] = 1
    dp[1] = 1
    // Bottom-up DP
    for (i in 2..n) {
        // Iterate from 1 to X, to use the node as root
        for (j in 1..i) {
            // Then sum up the combination count of left/right children.
            dp[i] += dp[j - 1] * dp[i - j]
        }
    }
    return dp[n]
}
```

* **Time Complexity**: `O(n^2)` for every `n`, we have to iterate from 1 to `n` to use the node as root to calulation it children combination count.
* **Space Complexity**: `O(n)`.
