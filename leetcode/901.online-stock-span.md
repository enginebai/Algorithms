We store the price and **how many days that prices is less than the current price** (the span) into stack. So that we will know the total days before that price is less than or equal to the current price.

```js
Price = 60
Stack: [60,1]

Price = 70
// We pop [60,1] and update the span for 70
Stack: [70,1+1]

Price = 60
Stack: [70,2] / [60,1]

Price = 75
// Pop [60,1] / [70,2]
Stack: [75, 1+1+2]
// First 1 for 75, second 1 from [60,1], 2 from [70,2]

```

```kotlin
// Monotonic decreasing stack
private val stack = Stack<IntArray>()

fun next(price: Int): Int {
    var answer = 1
    while (stack.isNotEmpty() && stack.peek()[0] <= price) {
        val array = stack.pop()
        val span = array[1]
        answer += span
    }
    stack.push(intArrayOf(price, answer))
    return answer
}
```

* **Time Complexity**: One price will be pushed once and popped once. So `2n` times stack operations and `n` times calls, time complexity is amortized `O(1)`
* **Space Complexity**: `O(n)` for stack.
