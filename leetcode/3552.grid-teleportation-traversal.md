# [3552. Grid Teleportation Traversal](https://leetcode.com/problems/grid-teleportation-traversal/)

## Key Insights
We can model this problem as a graph (grid) problem. We can use BFS to find the shortest path, but we need to consider the teleportation. Walking to a neighbor costs 1 step, teleporting via a portal costs 0 step (but can be used at most once per letter), our grid becomes a **weighted graph with edge weight only 0 or 1**. A plain BFS assumes all edges have the same weight, and Dijkstra's algorithm with priority queue works but adds extra complexity, so **0-1 BFS** is the perfect middle ground:

### Why 0-1 BFS?
The grid has exactly two weights:
- Teleport: `0`
- Normal walk: `1`

### How to enqueue?
- When traversing to a neighbor, we enqueue **at the end** of queue as normal BFS, since it's a normal movement.
- When traversing to portal, we enqueue **at first** of queue, since teleportation doesn't count as a normal movement, it stays in the same layer of current position, we explore it **immediately at the same "level"**.

## BFS
Based on the key insights, we can implement the *0-1 BFS* with precomputing portals.

- We use hash map to store the portals for each letter, and a boolean array to track if we have used the portal for each letter.
- Define a matrix to track the distance to each cell, relax and enqueue when we find a shorter path. This is the same as [542. 01 Matrix](542.01-matrix.md).
- We have to process the portal 

```kotlin
fun minMoves(matrix: Array<String>): Int {
    val m = matrix.size
    val n = matrix.first().length

    // Pre-compute the portals positions
    val usedPortal = BooleanArray(26)
    val portals = Array(26) { mutableListOf<Pair<Int, Int>>() }
    for (i in 0 until m) {
        for (j in 0 until n) {
            val c = matrix[i][j]
            if (c in 'A'..'Z') portals[c - 'A'].add(i to j)
        }
    }

    val distance = Array(m) { IntArray(n) { Int.MAX_VALUE } }
    val queue = ArrayDeque<Pair<Int, Int>>()
    queue.addLast(0 to 0)
    distance[0][0] = 0
    while (queue.isNotEmpty()) {
        val (x, y) = queue.removeFirst()

        val c = matrix[x][y]
        // Process portal (weight 0)
        if (c in 'A'..'Z' && usedPortal[c - 'A'].not()) {
            val p = portals[c - 'A']
            for (i in p.indices) {
                val (px, py) = p[i]
                if (distance[px][py] > distance[x][y]) {
                    distance[px][py] = distance[x][y]
                    // NOTE: Enqueue the portal at the first of queue
                    queue.addFirst(px to py)
                }
            }
            usedPortal[c - 'A'] = true
        }

        // Normal walk (weight 1): General implementation of BFS for shortest path
        for (d in directions) {
            val newX = x + d[0]
            val newY = y + d[1]
            if (newX in 0 until m && newY in 0 until n && matrix[newX][newY] != '#') {
                if (distance[newX][newY] > distance[x][y] + 1) {
                    distance[newX][newY] = distance[x][y] + 1
                    // Enqueue the adjacent node at the end of queue
                    queue.addLast(newX to newY)
                }
            }
        }
    }

    val ans = distance[m - 1][n - 1]
    return if (ans == Int.MAX_VALUE) -1 else ans
}
```

- **Time Complexity**: `O(m * n + P)`, we visit each cell at most once, and process each portal at most once.
- **Space Complexity**: `O(m * n + P)`, we use a matrix to track the distance to each cell, and a hash map to store the portals for each letter.

```js
source -> ... weight 0 -> destination
       -> ... weight 1 -> destination
       ...
       -> ... weight 5 -> destination
```
