# [1446. Consecutive Characters](https://leetcode.com/problems/consecutive-characters/)

## Compare adjacent characters
1. Initialize `power` and `len` to 1 since a single character has power 1.
2. Iterate through the string starting from index 1.
3. If the current character matches the previous character, increment the current length.
4. If the characters don't match, reset the length to 1.
5. Update the maximum power after each iteration.

```kotlin
fun maxPower(s: String): Int {
    var power = 1
    var len = 1
    for (i in 1 until s.length) {
        if (s[i - 1] == s[i]) {
            len++
        } else {
            len = 1
        }
        power = maxOf(power, len)
    }
    return power
}

// Or equivalent: we track the previous character to check if it's consecutive.
fun maxPower(s: String): Int {
    var power = 0
    var len = 0
    var previous = ' '
    for (i in 0 until s.length) {
        if (s[i] == previous) {
            len++
        } else {
            len = 1
            previous = s[i]
        }
        power = maxOf(power, len)
    }
    return power
}
```

## Group by Consecutive
Use a while loop to group consecutive identical characters, measuring the length of each group and updating the maximum found.

```kotlin
fun maxPower(s: String): Int {
    var power = 0
    var i = 0
    while (i < s.length) {
        val current = s[i]
        val start = i
        i++
        while (i < s.length && s[i] == current) {
            i++
        }
        // `i` will be the next index of the current group. (the start of the next group)
        power = maxOf(power, i - start)
    }
    return power
}

// Or equivalent: We move `i` only when we have the same "next" character. `i` will stop at the end of the current group.
fun maxPower(s: String): Int {
    var power = 0
    var i = 0
    while (i < s.length) {
        val current = s[i]
        val start = i
        while (i + 1 < s.length && s[i + 1] == current) {
            i++
        }
        power = maxOf(power, i - start + 1)
        i++
    }
    return power
}
```

Or the same idea but to use a sliding window to expand over runs of identical characters.
```kotlin
fun maxPower(s: String): Int {
    var power = 0
    var i = 0
    while (i < s.length) {
        var j = i
        while (j < s.length && s[i] == s[j]) j++
        // `j` will be the next index of the current group. (the start of the next group)
        power = maxOf(power, j - i)
        i = j
    }
    return power
}
```

All implementations are `O(n)` time and `O(1)` space.
