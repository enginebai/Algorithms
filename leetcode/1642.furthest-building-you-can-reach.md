## [1642. Furthest Building You Can Reach](https://leetcode.com/problems/furthest-building-you-can-reach)

We use ladder first if we have enough ladder, but if we don't have enough ladder, then we change the smallest height difference to use brick if the number of brick is enough for that smallest height difference.

```js
    [6, 5, 5, 10, 12, 100, 106, 208, 207, 208], 10 bricks, 2 ladders
diff   -1, 0,  5,  2,  82,   6, 102, -1,    
                        *         *
             // We should use ladder here
```

```kotlin
fun furthestBuilding(heights: IntArray, bricks: Int, ladders: Int): Int {
    var furthestIndex = 0
    val minHeap = PriorityQueue<Int>()
    var remainingBricks = bricks

    // Iterate i from the 2nd height to that last
    for (i in 1 until heights.size) {
        // Calculate the height diffence
        val heightDiff = heights[i] - heights[i - 1]

        // If difference <= 0, we can move without any bricks or ladders
        if (heightDiff <= 0) {
            furthestIndex = i
        } else {
            minHeap.add(heightDiff)
            // We have enough ladder, just use it
            if (minHeap.size <= ladders) {
                furthestIndex = i
            } else {
                // We don't have enough ladder, then try to change
                // the smallest height difference
                // to use the remaining brick.
                if (minHeap.isNotEmpty() && minHeap.peek() <= remainingBricks) {
                    remainingBricks -= minHeap.poll()
                    furthestIndex = i
                } else {
                    break
                }
            }
        }
    }
    return furthestIndex
}
```

* **Time Complexity**: `O(n lg k)`, `k` is the number of ladders.
* **Space Complexity**: `O(lg k)`
