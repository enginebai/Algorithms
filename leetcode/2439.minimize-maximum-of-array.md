# [2439. Minimize Maximum of Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimize-maximum-of-array/description/)

## Hints
- What happens if you always move excess from right to left?
- Can you check if a given maximum value is feasible using a greedy simulation?
- Is there a way to relate the answer to prefix sums or averages?

## Breakdowns
> 1. Can we check if a given value is feasible as the maximum after all operations?

Try simulating the process from right to left, moving excess to the left. If the first element can be kept ≤ threshold, it's feasible.

> 2. Is there a direct formula for the answer?

Notice that after all possible operations, the array becomes as flat as possible. The answer is the maximum of all prefix averages (rounded up).

## Key Insights
- The operation allows you to move any excess from right to left, so the leftmost elements can absorb all surplus.
- The minimum possible maximum is determined by the largest prefix average (since you can't make the prefix sum smaller than its average).
- (TODO) There is also a direct greedy solution using prefix averages, which is more efficient and elegant.

## Binary Search
- **Monotonicity**: If a value is feasible, any larger value is also feasible.
- **Lower bound**: The minimum value in the array would be acceptable. (Consider the single element case)
- **Upper bound**: The maximum value in the array. (Without any modification)
- **Feasibility**: There are two ways to check if a value is feasible:
    - Check 1: Check if we have enough buffer to absorb all excess.
    - Check 2: Simulate moving excess from right to left and check if the first element stays ≤ threshold.

```kotlin
fun minimizeArrayValue(nums: IntArray): Int {
    var left = nums.min()
    var right = nums.max()
    while (left <= right) {
        val middle = left + (right - left) / 2
        val feasible = check(nums, middle)
        if (feasible) {
            right = middle - 1
        } else {
            left = middle + 1
        }
    }
    return left
}

// Check 1: Check if we have enough buffer to absorb all excess.
private fun check(nums: IntArray, threshold: Int): Boolean {
    var buffer = 0L
    for (num in nums) {
        buffer += (threshold - num).toLong()
        if (buffer < 0L) return false
    }
    return true
}

// Or alternatively, check 2: Simulate moving excess from right to left and check if the first element stays ≤ threshold.
private fun check2(nums: IntArray, threshold: Int): Boolean {
    var excess = 0L
    for (i in nums.size - 1 downTo 1) {
        if (nums[i] + excess > threshold) {
            excess = nums[i] + excess - threshold
        } else {
            // We can't pass negative excess to the left because:
            // 1. The operation only allows moving excess from right to left
            // 2. If we have a deficit (negative excess), we can't "borrow" from the left
            // 3. The left elements can only absorb surplus, not create it
            excess = 0L
        }
    }
    return nums[0] + excess <= threshold
}
```

- **Time Complexity**: `O(n log(max(nums)))`
- **Space Complexity**: `O(1)`

## Prefix Average (Optimal Greedy)

> TODO: Understand this approach later.

Key idea: The answer is the maximum of all prefix averages (rounded up).

```kotlin
fun minimizeArrayValue(nums: IntArray): Int {
    var maxAvg = 0L
    var prefixSum = 0L
    for (i in nums.indices) {
        prefixSum += nums[i]
        val avg = (prefixSum + i) / (i + 1) // ceil division
        maxAvg = maxOf(maxAvg, avg)
    }
    return maxAvg.toInt()
}
```

- **Time Complexity**: `O(n)`
- **Space Complexity**: `O(1)`

## Edge Cases
- All elements are the same: The answer is that value.
- Large values at the end: The excess will be pushed to the leftmost element.
- Single element: The answer is the element itself.
- Very large input: Use `Long` for prefix sum to avoid overflow.

## Pitfalls
- **Forgetting to use `Long` for prefix sum or excess, causing overflow.**
- **Not resetting excess to 0 when redistributing in the binary search check.**
- Off-by-one error in prefix average calculation (should use `(prefixSum + i) / (i + 1)` for ceiling division).

## WA
```kotlin
fun minimizeArrayValue(nums: IntArray): Int {
    // Binary search bounds are correct - we search between min and max values
    var left = nums.min()
    var right = nums.max()
    while (left <= right) {
        val middle = left + (right - left) / 2
        val feasible = check(nums, middle)
        if (feasible) {
            right = middle - 1
        } else {
            left = middle + 1
        }
    }
    return left
}

private fun check(nums: IntArray, threshold: Int): Boolean {
    // ISSUE 1: Modifying input array directly is dangerous and can affect future checks
    // ISSUE 2: The logic doesn't properly handle the case where we need to move values from right to left
    var max = nums.last()
    for (i in nums.size - 1 downTo 0) {
        if (i > 0) {
            while (nums[i - 1] < nums[i]) {
                nums[i]--
                nums[i - 1]++
            }
        }
        max = maxOf(max, nums[i])
        if (threshold < max) return false
    }
    return true
}
```
