# [253. Meeting Rooms II](https://leetcode.com/problems/meeting-rooms-ii)

## Problem
Given an array of meeting time intervals consisting of start and end times `[[s1,e1],[s2,e2],...]` (si < ei), find the minimum number of conference rooms required.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: [[0, 30],[5, 10],[15, 20]]
Output: 2
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: [[7,10],[2,4]]
Output: 1
```

## Key Insights
* We need a extra meeting room if there is any overlap between meetings.
```js
[[1, 3], [2, 4]]

1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8
|-----|                 // Room 1
   |-----|              // Room 2
```
* But we can reuse a meeting room if the two meetings are not overlapping so that we can have the minimum number of meeting rooms.
```js
[[1, 3], [2, 4], [5, 7]]

1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8
|-----|     |-----|     // Room 1
   |-----|              // Room 2
```

**NOTE** This is a classic problem of finding the maximum number of overlapping intervals at any point of time, and it's a prenium problem on LeetCode, so we move the key notes to [2406. Divide Intervals Into Minimum Number of Groups](../leetcode/2406.divide-intervals-into-minimum-number-of-groups.md), the ideas and implementations are the same.
