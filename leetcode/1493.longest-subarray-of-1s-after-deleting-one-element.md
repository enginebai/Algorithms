# [1493. Longest Subarray of 1's After Deleting One Element](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-subarray-of-1s-after-deleting-one-element/description/)

## Test Cases
### Edge / Corner Cases
* All `0's` or all `1's`.
```
Input: [0, 0, 0]
Output: 0

Input: [1, 1, 1]
Output: 3 - 1, we must delete one element.
```


## Breakdowns
> 1. How to find the longest 1's without deletion?

Iterate all elements, and start counting when meeting the first `1's`, then update the answer. Or (Optimized) slding window with `1's`.

> 2. How to find the longest 1's that allow only one 0's?

Sliding window with `0's count`, expand the window until we have more than one `0's`, then shrink the window from the left until `0's` count <= 1.

> 3. How to find the answer for the input: zero 0's, one 0's, two 0's, all 0's?

* zero 0's: return `len(s) - 1`
* one 0's: return `longest - 1`
* two 0's: return `longest - 1`
* all 0's: return `0`

## Sliding Window   
* Window: the longest substring of `1's` with at most `k == 1` `0's`. (There is no `0's` or one `0's`) 
* We can track the number of `0's` in the window, and shrink the window when the number of `0's` is more than 1.
* If there are all `0's` in the window, we can return `0`, otherwise, we can return the length of the window - 1.

```kotlin
fun longestSubarray(nums: IntArray): Int {
    var zeroCount = 0
    var left = 0
    var longest = Int.MIN_VALUE
    for (right in nums.indices) {
        if (nums[right] == 0) zeroCount++
        while (zeroCount > 1) {
            if (nums[left] == 0) zeroCount--
            left++
        }
        longest = maxOf(longest, right - left + 1)
    }

    return if (longest == Int.MIN_VALUE) 0 else longest - 1
}

// Or equivalently
fun longestSubarray(nums: IntArray): Int {
    var count0 = 0
    var left = 0
    var ans = 0 // Here we don't have to use Int.MIN_VALUE, if there are all 0's, the answer is always 0.
    for (right in nums.indices) {
        if (nums[right] == 0) count0++
        while (count0 > 1) {
            if (nums[left] == 0) count0--
            left++
        }
        // Here we don't -1, because we have to delete one element.
        ans = maxOf(ans, right - left)
    }
    return ans
}
