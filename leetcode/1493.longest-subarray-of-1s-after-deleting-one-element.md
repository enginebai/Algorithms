# [1493. Longest Subarray of 1's After Deleting One Element](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-subarray-of-1s-after-deleting-one-element/description/)

## Breakdowns
> 1. How to find the longest 1's without deletion?

Iterate all elements, and start counting when meeting the first 1's, then update the answer.

> 2. How to find the longest 1's that allow only one 0's?

Sliding window with 0's count, expand the window until we have more than one 0's, then shrink the window from the left until 0's count <= 1.

> 3. How to find the answer for the input: zero 0's, one 0's, two 0's, all 0's?

* zero 0's: return len(s) - 1
* one 0's: return longest - 1
* two 0's: return longest - 1
* all 0's: return 0

## Sliding Window   
* Window: the longest substring of `1's` with at most one `0's`. We can track the number of `0's` in the window, and shrink the window when the number of `0's` is more than 1.
```kotlin
fun longestSubarray(nums: IntArray): Int {
    var zeroCount = 0
    var left = 0
    var longest = 0
    var allZeros = true
    for (right in nums.indices) {
        if (nums[right] == 0) {
            zeroCount++
        } else {
            allZeros = false
        }
        while (zeroCount > 1) {
            if (nums[left] == 0) zeroCount--
            left++
        }
        longest = maxOf(longest, right - left + 1)
    }

    return if (allZeros) 0 else longest - 1
}
```
