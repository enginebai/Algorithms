# [224. Basic Calculator](https://leetcode.com/problems/basic-calculator/)

## Clarification Questions
* Is the input string always valid? (i.e. no invalid characters, the parentheses are always balanced, etc.)
 
## Test Cases
### Normal Cases
```
Input: 
Output: 
```
### Edge / Corner Cases
* There are multiple nested parentheses.
```
Input: 
Output: 
```

## Stack
For this basic calculator, there are several cases we need to consider:
1. The number: We need to build the number from digits. Mind the number can be more than one digit.
2. The operator `+/-`: We need to calculate the result based on the operator.
3. `(`: We start to calculate the result inside the parenthese. We have parenthese that we have to calculate first, then sum up the results before and inside the parenthese. Since we need to cache the result and sign, we can use a stack to store the previous result and sign before the parenthese. 
4. `)`: We finish calculating the result inside the parenthese, we need to sum up the previous result (cached in the stack) and the current result inside the parenthese. 

Here we use a variable `result` for the current evaluation, and we push the previous result and sign before the parenthese to the stack when we meet `(`, then we reset `result` for calculating the result inside the parenthese.

Let's use `9+1-(3+2)-5` as example, we add/substract the number one by one from the beginning, 0 + 9 at first and keep adding (`sign * number`) if we meet operator.

```kotlin
fun calculate(s: String): Int {
    val stack = Stack<Int>()
    // The current evaluation
    var result = 0
    // The current operand builder
    var number = 0
    // +/- symbol
    var sign = 1
    for (i in 0 until s.length) {
        if (s[i].isDigit()) {
            // Build the current number from digits
            number = number * 10 + (s[i] - '0')
        } 
        else if (s[i] == '(') {
            // XYZ +/- (
            // Cache the current result XYZ and sign before parenthese
            stack.push(result)
            stack.push(sign)
            
            // Reset all state and use them to calculate the value inside parenthese
            result = 0
            number = 0
            sign = 1
        } else if (s[i] == ')') {
            // Finish calculating the result before ')'
            result += number * sign
            number = 0
            sign = 1

            // Calculate the previous result (before parenthese) and the result inside the parenthese
            result *= stack.pop() // It will be the sign before the parenthese, i.e. -
            result += stack.pop() // It's previous result calculated before the parenthese, i.e. 10
        } else if (s[i] == '+') {
            result += number * sign
            sign = 1
            number = 0
        } else if (s[i] == '-') {
            result += number * sign
            sign = -1
            number = 0
        }
    }

    // We calculate the remaining number, from above example, it ..)-5
    if (number != 0) result += number * sign
    return result
}
