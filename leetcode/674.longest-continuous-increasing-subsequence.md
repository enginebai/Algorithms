# [674. Longest Continuous Increasing Subsequence](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-continuous-increasing-subsequence/)

## Hints
- Try to use two pointers or a sliding window to track the current increasing subarray.
- What should you do when the sequence is no longer increasing?

## Breakdowns
> 1. How do you identify the start and end of a continuous increasing subarray?

Keep a pointer to the start of the current increasing sequence. When the next number is not greater than the previous, reset the start.

> 2. How do you efficiently find the longest such subarray?

Iterate through the array, updating the maximum length whenever the sequence continues, and resetting when it breaks.

## Key Insights
- This is a classic sliding window/two pointers problem where the window expands as long as the sequence is strictly increasing.
- Reset the window whenever the sequence is not increasing.
- Greedy and two pointers both work efficiently for this problem.

## Test Cases
### Normal Cases
```
Input: nums = [1,2,5,3,4,5,6]
Output: 4

Input: nums = [1,2,5,6,3,4,5]
Output: 4
```
### Edge / Corner Cases
* All elements are equal:
```
Input: nums = [1,1,1,1,1,1,1]
Output: 1
```

* All elements are decreasing:
```
Input: nums = [7,6,5,4,3,2,1]
Output: 1
```

## Sliding Window
The problem asks for the longest continuous **subarray** which must be continuous.

```kotlin
fun findLengthOfLCIS(nums: IntArray): Int {
    var i = 0
    var j = 0
    var maxLength = 0
    var currentMax = Int.MIN_VALUE
    while (j < nums.size) {
        if (nums[j] > currentMax) {
            currentMax = nums[j]
            maxLength = max(maxLength, j - i + 1)
        } else {
            i = j
            currentMax = nums[i]
        }
        j++
    }
    return maxLength
}
```

## Two Pointers (Group by Consecutive)
```kotlin
fun findLengthOfLCIS(nums: IntArray): Int {
    var ans = 0
    var i = 0
    while (i < nums.size) {
        val start = i
        i++
        while (i < nums.size && nums[i - 1] < nums[i]) {
            i++
        }
        ans = maxOf(ans, i - start)
    }
    return ans
}
```

## Greedy
1. If the current number is greater than previous, then increase the length and update the max length.
2. Else, reset the length.
```kotlin
fun findLengthOfLCIS(nums: IntArray): Int {
    var max = 1
    var currentLength = 1
    for (i in 1 until nums.size) {
        if (nums[i] > nums[i - 1]) {
            currentLength++
        } else {
            currentLength = 1
        }
        max = maxOf(max, currentLength)
    }
    return max
}
```

## Edge Cases
- All elements are the same: The answer is 1, since no increasing sequence exists.
- All elements are strictly decreasing: The answer is 1, for the same reason.
- The longest increasing sequence is at the start or end of the array.
- Array of length 1: The answer is 1.

## Pitfalls
- Forgetting to reset the current length or start pointer when the sequence breaks.
- Off-by-one errors when calculating the length of the current window (should be `end - start + 1` or `i - start`).
- Not handling arrays of length 0 or 1 correctly.
