# [2101. Detonate the Maximum Bombs](https://leetcode.com/problems/detonate-the-maximum-bombs/description)

## DFS
If bomb B is in the range of bomb A, then bomb B will be detonated when bomb A is detonated, there is an edge `A -> B` in the bomb graph. If bomb C is in the range of bomb B, then `B -> C`, we can detonate bomb A, and bump B and C will be detonated.

We can build a graph based on the range of bombs, then we can use DFS to find the maximum number of bombs that can be detonated (the number of nodes).

```kotlin
private var maxDetonated = 0

fun maximumDetonation(bombs: Array<IntArray>): Int {
    val graph = buildGraph(bombs)
    for (i in 0 until bombs.size) {
        val visited = HashSet<Int>()
        val count = dfs(graph, i, visited)
        maxDetonated = maxOf(maxDetonated, count)
    }
    return maxDetonated
}

private fun dfs(graph: HashMap<Int, HashSet<Int>>, index: Int, visited: HashSet<Int>): Int {
    if (visited.contains(index)) return 0
    visited.add(index)
    var count = 1
    graph[index]?.forEach { adj ->
        count += dfs(graph, adj, visited)
    }
    return count
}

private fun buildGraph(bombs: Array<IntArray>): HashMap<Int, HashSet<Int>> {
    val graph = HashMap<Int, HashSet<Int>>()
    for (i in 0 until bombs.size) {
        if (graph.containsKey(i).not()) graph[i] = HashSet<Int>()
        for (j in 0 until bombs.size) {
            if (i == j) continue
            if (inRange(bombs[i], bombs[j])) {
                graph[i]!!.add(j)
            }
        }
    }
    return graph
}

private fun inRange(from: IntArray, to: IntArray): Boolean {
    val distance = Math.sqrt((Math.pow(from[0] * 1.0 - to[0], 2.0) +
                        Math.pow(from[1] * 1.0 - to[1], 2.0)))
    return distance <= from[2].toDouble()
