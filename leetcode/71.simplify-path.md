# [71. Simplify Path](https://leetcode.com/problems/simplify-path/description/)

## Test Cases
```
Input: "/"
Output: "/"

Input: "/./" or "/../" or "/.././" or "/./../"
Output: "/"

Input: "/home//google//"
Output: "/home/google"

Input: "/home/user/google/./android//../youtube"
Output: "home/user/google/youtube"

Input: "/.../a/../b/c/../d/./"
Output: "/.../b/d"
```

## Stack
Becase we can navigate to parent or child directory, we can use stack that allows us to go back to parent directory and manage the directory levels easily.

We can split the input path by `/` first, then iterate the path. There will be 4 cases:
1. Empty string: Start or end of string, or multiple `/`, do nothing.
2. "." : Stay in current directory, do nothing.
3. ".." : Go back to parent directory if exists, pop the stack.
4. Other string (including multiple dots`...`): push to stack.

Finally, we can join the stack with "/" as separator.

```kotlin
fun simplifyPath(path: String): String {
    val separator = "/"
    val paths = path.split(separator)
    val stack = Stack<String>()
    for (split in paths) {
        when (split) {
            "", "." -> continue 
            ".." -> {
                if (stack.isNotEmpty()) { // It's not root, go to previous
                    stack.pop() 
                }
            }
            else -> {
                stack.push(split)
            }
        }
    }
    val simplifiedPath = stack.joinToString(separator)
    return separator + simplifiedPath
}
```
