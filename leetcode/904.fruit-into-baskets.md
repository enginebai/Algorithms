# [904. Fruit Into Baskets](https://leetcode.com/problems/fruit-into-baskets/description/)

## Sliding Window
We maintain a window that contains at most two types of fruits, we try to expand the window if the number of type is less than or equal to 2, otherwise we shrink the window from the left side.

```python
def totalFruit(self, fruits: List[int]) -> int:
    left, right = 0, 0
    baskets = {}
    pick = 0
    while right < len(fruits):
        baskets[fruits[right]] = baskets.get(fruits[right], 0) + 1
        while len(baskets.keys()) > 2:
            baskets[fruits[left]] -= 1
            if baskets[fruits[left]] == 0: del baskets[fruits[left]]
            left += 1
        pick = max(pick, right - left + 1)
        right += 1
    return pick
```
* **Time Complexity**: `O(n)`.
* **Space Complexity**: `O(1)`, there are at most 3 types of fruits in the baskets.
