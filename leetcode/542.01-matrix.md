# [542. 01 Matrix](https://leetcode.com/problems/01-matrix/)

## Clarification Questions
* Is there at least one `0's` in the matrix?
 
## Test Cases
### Edge / Corner Cases
* There are some `1` with different distances to the nearest `0's`.
```js
Input: 
0 0 0
0 1 1

Output: 
0 0 0
0 1 2
```
* All are `0's`.

## BFS
To find the shortest distance, we can use BFS. But if we search for `0's` for every `1`, it leads TLE (TC is `O((m * n)^2)`). Alteratively, we start the shorest distance calcluation from all `0's`. The distance from `0's` to itself is `0's`, and we can propagate the distance to all other cells.

We start a BFS from every `0's`, by enqueuing all `0's` initially, we ensure that the BFS will propagate the shortest distance to all other cells. For each cell popped out from the queue, we check the adjacent cells (not out-of-bound) if we can relax the distance, and enqueue the cell if the distance is updated for further exploration.

Here are the steps:
* Enqueue all `0's` and update the cells to `0's`.
* We keep popping out the cells from queue and update the distance of the adjacent cell if the distance is shorter.
* If the distance is updated, then enqueue the adjacency cell to queue.

> Why don't we need to check if the cell is visited?
1. **The `distances` array acts as the visited set**. Since we only update `distance[newX][newY]` if we find a shorter path, we are guaranteed to visite each cell at more once. A cell is "visited" once its shortest distance is determined.
2. BFS expands in a monotonic way, each cell is processed only when its shortest distance is known. This ensure we never revisit a cell with a longer path, avoiding redundant visit.

```kotlin
fun updateMatrix(mat: Array<IntArray>): Array<IntArray> {
    val m = mat.size
    val n = mat[0].size
    val distances = Array(m) { IntArray(n) { Int.MAX_VALUE } }

    val queue = ArrayDeque<Pair<Int, Int>>()
    for (i in 0 until m) {
        for (j in 0 until n) {
            if (mat[i][j] == 0) {
                queue.addLast(i to j)
                distances[i][j] = 0 
            }
        }
    }

    while (queue.isNotEmpty()) {
        val position = queue.removeFirst()
        val x = position.first
        val y = position.second
        directions.forEach { d -> 
            val newX = x + d[0]
            val newY = y + d[1]
            if (newX in 0 until m && newY in 0 until n) {
                // Here we do relaxation, and enqueue the node if we can relax.
                if (distances[newX][newY] > distances[x][y] + 1) {
                    distances[newX][newY] = distances[x][y] + 1
                    queue.addLast(newX to newY)
                }
            }
        }
    }
    return distances
}
```
