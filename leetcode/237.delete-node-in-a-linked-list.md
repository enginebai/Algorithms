## [237. Delete Node in a Linked List](https://leetcode.com/problems/delete-node-in-a-linked-list/)

```js
// To delete node [2]
1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4
     ^

// 1. Copy the next value to current node
1 -> 3 -> 3 -> 4
     ^

// 2. Then delete next node
1 -> 3 ------> 4

```

We just copy the next value to current one and relink to next of next node.

```kotlin
fun deleteNode(node: ListNode?) {
    if (node == null) return
    node.`val` = node.next!!.`val`
    node.next = node.next!!.next
}
```
