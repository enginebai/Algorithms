## [62. Unique Paths](https://leetcode.com/problems/unique-paths/)

### DP
The robic can only move right and down, when it arrived at a point, it either comes from left or above, let the `dp[i][j]` represent the unique path when arriving at `(i, j)`, and base cases will be `dp[i][0] = 1` and `dp[0][j] = 1` (only one direction can go)

```kotlin
fun uniquePaths(m: Int, n: Int): Int {
    if (m == 1 || n == 1) return 1
    val dp = Array(m) { _ -> IntArray(n) }
    for (i in 0 until m) dp[i][0] = 1
    for (j in 0 until n) dp[0][j] = 1

    for (i in 1 until m) {
        for (j in 1 until n) {
            dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j] + dp[i][j - 1] 
        }
    }
    return dp[m - 1][n - 1]
}
```
