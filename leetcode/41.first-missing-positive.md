## [41. First Missing Positive](https://leetcode.com/problems/first-missing-positive/)

### Hash
For array of size = `n`, the first missing positive numbe will be in the range of `1` to `n + 1` (inclusive).

**Idea!!** So we are going to **use array itself as hash table**, we use array index as key, and mark the element of that index as seen. For example, if we mark `A[1]` as negative number when we see `2` (not missing) (and 0-based index, we have to -1 for index).

But before mark the number to negative, we might contain negative in the beginning, and negative number would not be the answer, so we will change the negative number to `n + 1` (or some number out of normal range `[1..n + 1]`)

Then we start to mark the number we've seen and iterate the whole array to check if any number was not marked as negative. If all numbers were marked, then return `n + 1`. (`[1, 2, 3]` the answer will be 4)

```kotlin
fun firstMissingPositive(nums: IntArray): Int {
    val n = nums.size
    for (i in 0 until n) {
        if (nums[i] <= 0) nums[i] = n + 1
    }
    for (i in 0 until n) {
        // The number might be marked negative before, we have to operate using absolute numbers.
        val value = abs(nums[i])
        if (value in 1..n) {
            // -1 for 0-based index.
            // Using abs() for the same reason above
            nums[value - 1] = -abs(nums[value - 1])
        }
    }
    for (i in 0 until n) {
        if (nums[i] > 0) return i + 1
    }
    
    return n + 1
}
```

Or another solution would be placing the element to the position it should be, for example, `2` should be placed at `A[1]` (-1 for 0-based index), `[3, 4, -1, 1]` shoule be placed like `[1, -1, 3, 4]`

```kotlin
fun firstMissingPositive(nums: IntArray): Int {
    val n = nums.size
    for (i in 0 until n) {
        val value = nums[i]
        while (value in 1..n && nums[value - 1] != value) {
            nums.swap(i, value - 1)
        }
    } 

    for (i in 0 until n) {
        if (nums[i] != i + 1) return i + 1
    }
    return n + 1
}

private fun IntArray.swap(i: Int, j: Int) {
    val temp = this[i]
    this[i] = this[j]
    this[j] = temp
}
```


### Hash (`O(n)` Space Complexity)
It was AC but didn't meet `O(1)` space complexity requirement.

```kotlin
fun firstMissingPositive(nums: IntArray): Int {
    val hash = hashSetOf<Int>()
    for (num in nums) {
        hash.add(num)
    }
    for (i in 1 until Int.MAX_VALUE) {
        if (!hash.contains(i)) return i
    }
    return 0
}
```
