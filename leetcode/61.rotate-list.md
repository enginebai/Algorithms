# [61. Rotate List](https://leetcode.com/problems/rotate-list/)

## Hints
- Can you find the new head and tail after rotation?
- What's the effective number of rotations when `k` is larger than the list size?
- How can you use the concept of finding the k-th node from the end?

## Breakdowns

> 1. **How do you handle k larger than the list size?**
   - Calculate the effective rotation steps as `k % size`
   - This ensures we don't do unnecessary full rotations

> 2. **How do you find the new head and tail?**
   - The new tail is at position `size - k` from the start
   - The new head is the node after the new tail
   - Use the two pointers technique to find the k-th node from the end

> 3. **How do you reconnect the list?**
   - Break the link at the new tail
   - Connect the original tail to the original head
   - Return the new head

## Key Insights
1. To rotate the list by `k` steps, we can think of it as removing the last `k` nodes and moving them to the front.
2. The effective rotation steps is `k % size` to handle cases where `k` is larger than the list size.
3. We can use the two-pointer technique (similar to [19. Remove Nth Node From End of List](../leetcode/19.remove-nth-node-from-end-of-list.md)) to find the new tail efficiently.
4. The problem reduces to finding the new head and tail, then reconnecting the list appropriately.

> Think of the linked list as a circle temporarily, then break at the right place.

## Iterative
To rotate the list, we need to find the new head and tail after the rotation.

```js
1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5
          ^    ^
          tail |
              new head
```

1. Calculate the size of the list.
2. Calculate the effective rotation steps as `k % size`.
3. Find the new tail which is at position `size - k`. (The `k` node from the end of the list)
4. Break the link at the new tail and connect it to the head.

```js
k = 2
1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5
*              *       // the 2nd node from the end
head      |    |    |
      previous |    |
               |    |
             slow   last

previous?.next = null   // 3 -> null
newHead = slow          // 4
last.next = head    // 5 -> 1

// Result
4 -> 5 -> 1 -> 2 -> 3
```          

```kotlin
fun rotateRight(head: ListNode?, k: Int): ListNode? {
    if (head == null || head.next == null) return head

    var size = 0
    var current = head
    var last = head
    while (current != null) {
        size++
        last = current
        current = current.next
    }
    val kk = k % size
    if (kk == 0) return head

    // Use the same technique as [19. Remove Nth Node From End of List](../leetcode/19.remove-nth-node-from-end-of-list.md)
    var previous: ListNode? = null
    var slow = head
    var fast = head
    var i = 0
    while (i < kk) {
        fast = fast?.next
        i++
    }
    while (fast != null) {
        previous = slow
        slow = slow?.next
        fast = fast?.next
    }
    // Break the link at the new tail
    previous?.next = null

    // Update the new head and reconnect the list
    val newHead = slow
    last?.next = head
    return newHead
}
```

- **Time Complexity**: `O(N)`, where `N` is the number of nodes in the list.
- **Space Complexity**: `O(1)`, we only use a few pointers.

## Edge Cases
- **k = 0**: Return the head as is
- **k = size**: Return the head as is (full rotation)
- **k > size**: Use `k % size` to get effective rotation steps
- **Single node**: Return the head as is

## Pitfalls
- Not handling k > size: Always calculate `k % size` to get the effective rotation steps
- Not preserving the last node: Need to keep track of the last node to connect it to the original head
- Not handling empty or single node lists: These cases should be handled separately
- Not breaking the link at the new tail: This can lead to circular lists
