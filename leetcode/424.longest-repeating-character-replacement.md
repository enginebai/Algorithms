## [424. Longest Repeating Character Replacement](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-repeating-character-replacement/)

* Window maintains the longest repeating character replacement within `k` times.
* We update `longestRepeatingCount` so that we could know how many characters that we have to replace:

```js
windows = [AAABC]
              ^^
longestRepeatingCount = 3
// That means that we have to replace 2 characters.
```

```kotlin
fun characterReplacement(s: String, k: Int): Int {
    var left = 0
    var right = 0
    var longestRepeatingCount = 0
    var result = 0
    val sCount = IntArray(26)
    while (right < s.length) {
        sCount[s[right] - 'A']++
        longestRepeatingCount = maxOf(longestRepeatingCount, sCount[s[right] - 'A'])

        // If the difference between the current length and max repeated count > k, we have to shrink the window
        while (right - left + 1 - longestRepeatingCount > k) {
            sSount[s[left] - 'A']--
            left++

            // We don't have to update the max repeated count here, because when 
            // shriking the window, the count won't get larger.
        }
        result = max(result, right - left + 1)
        right++
    }
    return result
}
```

Here we don't track the longest repeating character, the `longestRepeatingCount` may be invalid at some points, but this doesn't matter, because it was valid earlier or later in the string, and all that matters is finding the max window that occurred anywhere in the string.

* **Time Complexity**: `O(n)`.
* **Space Complexity**: `O(1)`.

### Sample Test Cases
```js
k = 1
s = 'C, C, B, A, A, A, A
```
