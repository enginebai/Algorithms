# [1145. Binary Tree Coloring Game](https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-coloring-game/)

## Key Insights
Player 1 colors any node `x` first, and player 2 then colors any other uncolored node `y` adjacent to `x`. Once player 1 colors node x, the tree is logically split into 3 disjoint regions:

- Left subtree of `x`
- Right subtree of `x`
- Parent subtree of `x`

```js
      [parent of x]
            |
            x
         /     \
[left subtree] [right subtree]
```

Play 2 can choose one of the 3 subtrees to color, and play 1 can only color the rest of the 2 subtrees. Player 2 will take over that chosen subtree, and player 1 will not be able to color any node in that chosen subtree by player 2.

So if player 2 chosen subtree > `n / 2`, then player 1 get < `n / 2` nodes to color, and player 2 wins.

## Postorder Traversal
We just calculate the node of each subtree and identify the 3 choices for player 2.

```kotlin
private var xSum = 0
private var xLeftSum = 0
private var xRightSum = 0

fun btreeGameWinningMove(root: TreeNode?, n: Int, x: Int): Boolean {
    val total = sum(root, x)
    return (total - xSum) > n / 2 || xLeftSum > n / 2 || xRightSum > n / 2
}

private fun sum(root: TreeNode?, x: Int): Int {
    if (root == null) return 0
    val left = sum(root.left, x)
    val right = sum(root.right, x)
    val total = 1 + left + right
    if (root.`val` == x) {
        xSum = total
        xLeftSum = left
        xRightSum = right
    }
    return total
}
```
