# [678. Valid Parenthesis String](https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-parenthesis-string/description/)

## Stack (Greedy)
Let's break down the problem, we can consider the problem if we don't have `*`, how to check if the string is valid? We can simply use a counter to count the number of unmatched left parenthesis. 

* Left parenthesis: we increment the counter.
* Right parenthesis: we decrement the counter.

And we have check if `right > left` during the iteration and `left == 0` at the end.
* `right > left`: It's impossible to match later even if we still have parenthesis.
* `left != 0`: It's impossible to match at the end.

> Similar idea from [921. Minimum Add to Make Parentheses Valid](../leetcode/921.minimum-add-to-make-parentheses-valid.md).

```kotlin
fun checkValidString(s: String): Boolean {
    var leftCount = 0 // unmatched left parenthesis
    for (c in s) {
        if (c == '(') {
            leftCount++
        } else if (c == ')') {
            leftCount--
        }
        
        // If right > left, it's impossible to match later
        if (leftCount < 0) {
            return false
        }
    }
    // We must balance all left parenthesis at the end
    return leftCount == 0
}
```

Based on this idea, we can extend the problem to include `*`, it can be either `(`, `)` or empty. It will affect the number of unmatched left parenthesis because if it acts as `(`, we increment the counter, if it acts as `)`, we decrement the counter. We can track **the possible range of unmatched left parenthesis**, we can use two counters as lower and upper bounds to keep track of the number of unmatched left parenthesis:

* Lower bound: If we use all `*` as `)` if possible, then all left parenthesis **MUST** be matched.
* Upper bound: If we use all `*` as `(` if possible, then some left parenthesis **COULD** be matched. If there are too many `(`, we just alter some `*` to `)` to match the left parenthesis.

And we can modify the above code to handle the `*` case:
```kotlin
fun checkValidString(s: String): Boolean {
    var leftCountMin = 0 // try to use `*` as right if possible
    var leftCountMax = 0 // try to use `*` as left if possible
    for (c in s) {
        if (c == '(') {
            leftCountMin++
            leftCountMax++
        } else if (c == ')') {
            leftCountMin--
            leftCountMax--
        } else { // `*`
            leftCountMin-- // use `*` as right
            leftCountMax++ // Use `*` as left
        }
        
        // We have to handle right > left at this moment, see below 2 cases:

        // 1. If we use all possible `*` as left but right still more than left, that's impossible to match later.
        // Example: "(*)))"
        if (leftCountMax < 0) {
            return false
        }

        // 2. We have right > left, but we can alter some `*` from right to left to match.
        // Example: "()**", min is to use * as right, we alter the first `*` to left to match the right parenthesis.
        if (leftCountMin < 0) {
            leftCountMin = 0 // It becomes balanced again.
        }
    }
    // For balanced string, leftCountMin <= leftCountMax at any moment
    // The parentheses are balanced if `0 <= [leftCountMin, leftCountMax]`
    // If lelftCountMin != 0, that means we use all `*` as right but still have unmatched left parenthesis.
    // But we allow max count != 0 because we can alter `*` to match the left parenthesis.
    return leftCountMin == 0
}
```

## WA
It failed by simply counting the `*`. Failed case: `**((`, the count of `*` is 2, but it's invalid because we can't match the left parenthesis when using `*` as right.
```kotlin
fun checkValidString(s: String): Boolean {
    var leftCount = 0
    var starCount = 0
    for (c in s) {
        if (c == '*') starCount++
        else if (c == '(') {
            leftCount++
        } else {
            leftCount--
        }

        if (leftCount < 0) {
            if (starCount + leftCount >= 0) {
                starCount += leftCount
                leftCount = 0
            } else {
                return false
            }
        }
    }
    return starCount >= leftCount
}
```
