# [678. Valid Parenthesis String](https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-parenthesis-string/description/)

## Test Cases
### Edge Cases
* No `*`: `""`, `()`, `())`
* Balanced `*` + valid string: ``, `()`, `*`, `(*)`, `()()*`
* All `*`: `***`, always valid.
* More `)` than possible `*`: `()*)))`, impossible to be valid.
* Leading or trailing `*`: `*()`, `()**`, `**()`, `*()*`.

## Key Insights
> Question: If we don't have `*`, how to check if the string is balanced? 

We can simply use a counter to count the number of unmatched left parenthesis. It's similar idea from [921. Minimum Add to Make Parentheses Valid](../leetcode/921.minimum-add-to-make-parentheses-valid.md).

* `L`: we increment the counter.
* `R`: we decrement the counter.

And we have check if `right > left` during the iteration and `left == 0` at the end.
* `right > left`: Too many `right`, it's impossible to match later even if we still have parenthesis.
* `left != 0`: Too many `left`, it's impossible to match at the end.

```kotlin
fun checkValidString(s: String): Boolean {
    var leftCount = 0 // unmatched left parenthesis
    for (c in s) {
        if (c == '(') {
            leftCount++
        } else if (c == ')') {
            leftCount--
        }
        
        // If right > left, it's impossible to match later
        if (leftCount < 0) {
            return false
        }
    }
    // We must balance all left parenthesis at the end
    return leftCount == 0
}
```

## Stack (Greedy)
Based on this idea, we can extend the idea to include `*` which can be either `(`, `)` or empty. It will affect the number of unmatched left parenthesis based on how we use `*` as `L` (`leftCount++`) or `R` (`leftCount--`).

- If we use all `*` as `L`, then the left count will be maximum.
- If we use all `*` as `R`, then the left count will be minimum.

The left count varies based on our choice of `*`, so we need to track **the possible range of unmatched left parenthesis**, we can use two counters as lower and upper bounds to keep track of the number of unmatched left parenthesis:

* Minimum of left count (lower bound): If we use all `*` as `R`, we can match as many `(` as possible, so the left count will be minimum. Then all the remaining `(` parenthesis **MUST** be matched.
* Maximum of left count (upper bound): If we use all `*` as `L` if possible, then some left parenthesis **COULD** be matched. If there are too many `(`, we just alter some `*` to `)` to match the left parenthesis.

And we can modify the above code to handle the `*` case:
```kotlin
fun checkValidString(s: String): Boolean {
    var leftCountMin = 0 // try to use `*` as R if possible
    var leftCountMax = 0 // try to use `*` as L if possible
    for (c in s) {
        if (c == '(') {
            leftCountMin++
            leftCountMax++
        } else if (c == ')') {
            leftCountMin--
            leftCountMax--
        } else { // `*`
            leftCountMin-- // use `*` as R or empty
            leftCountMax++ // Use `*` as L
        }
        
        // We have to handle right > left at this moment, see below 2 cases:

        // 1. We use all `*` as L, but R is still > L, impossible to be balanced later.
        // Example: "(*)))", we use `*` as left = "(()))", but we can't match the right parenthesis.
        if (leftCountMax < 0) {
            return false
        }

        // 2.  We use all * as R, but R > L, we can alter some * to be L to balance.
        // Example: "()**", minimum is to use * as `)` = "()))", there are too many `)`,
        // we alter the first `*` to `(` to match the right parenthesis = "(())".
        if (leftCountMin < 0) {
            leftCountMin = 0 // It becomes balanced again.
        }
    }
    // For balanced string, leftCountMin <= leftCountMax at any moment
    // The parentheses are balanced if `0 <= [leftCountMin, leftCountMax]`
    // If lelftCountMin != 0, that means we use all `*` as right but still have unmatched left parenthesis.
    // But we allow max count != 0 because we can alter `*` to match the left parenthesis.
    return leftCountMin == 0
}
```

## WA
It failed by simply counting the `*`. Failed case: `**((`, the count of `*` is 2, but it's invalid because we can't match the left parenthesis when using `*` as right.
```kotlin
fun checkValidString(s: String): Boolean {
    var leftCount = 0
    var starCount = 0
    for (c in s) {
        if (c == '*') starCount++
        else if (c == '(') {
            leftCount++
        } else {
            leftCount--
        }

        if (leftCount < 0) {
            if (starCount + leftCount >= 0) {
                starCount += leftCount
                leftCount = 0
            } else {
                return false
            }
        }
    }
    return starCount >= leftCount
}
```
