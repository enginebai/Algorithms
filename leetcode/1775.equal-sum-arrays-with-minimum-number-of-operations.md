# [1775. Equal Sum Arrays With Minimum Number of Operations](https://leetcode.com/problems/equal-sum-arrays-with-minimum-number-of-operations/description/)

## Greedy + Two Pointers
**Idea!** To make the two sum's equal with the minimum nubmer of operation, we should maximize the increase of the smaller sum array or minimize the decrease of the larger sum array.

We need either to increase to `6` in the smaller sum array or decrease to `1` in the larger sum array greedily. If we change all elements to `6` and its sum is still less than another array or change all elements to `1` and its sum is still larger than another array, it's impossible to make the two sums equal.

> Intuitions: We want to minimize the number of operations. So we pick 1 from the smaller array and change it to 6. Or, we pick 6 from the larger array and change it to 1. That's the fastest way to converge two sums.

Based on the above idea and suppose `sum(A) > sum(B)`, we can change the largest element in `A` to `1` to decrease `sum(A)`, or change the smallest number in `B` to `6` to increase `sum(B)` (if we still have numbers to change). We can repeat this process until `sum(A) <= sum(B)` or we have no number to change (return `-1`).

```js
-------|--------------------|--------
     sum(B)      <       sum(A)
      -->|                              // Increase sum(B) by changing the smallest number in B to 6
                             |<--   // Decrease sum(A) by changing the largest number in A to 1
         sum(A) <= sum(B)           // Until sum(A) <= sum(B) or we have no number to change
             |<--   -->|
```

Our greedy stragety is to change the largest number in `A` to `1` or the smallest number in `B` to `6` at each step. And we also choose the larger difference of change between `A` and `B` to change or either if they are equal.

```js
// The difference is the same
A = [..., 5]
    [..., 1] // 5 -> 1, difference = 4
B = [1, ...]
    [6, ...] // 1 -> 6, difference = 5, we choose B to change

// The difference is the same
A = [..., 6]
    [..., 1] // 6 -> 1, difference = 5
B = [1, ...]
    [6, ...] // 1 -> 6, difference = 5, we can choose either A or B to change
```

We repeat this process until `sum(A) <= sum(B)` or we have no number to change. The number of operations is the number of steps we take.

Why `sum(A) < sum(B)` is valid? It's over-adjusted, we can revert some numbers that we have changed before to make `sum(A) == sum(B)`. If target diff < 0, we can always make target diff == 0 by reverting some numbers from 6 to the less number or 1 to greater number, see the following example:

```js
A = [6, 6] = 12
        a       // 6 -> 1, difference = 5
B = [4, 5] = 9
     b          // 4 -> 6, difference = 2

// We choose A to change

// Sum(A) > Sum(B), and the difference to change A (6 -> 1) is larger than B, we choose A to change
A = [6, 1] = 7
     a
B = [4, 5] = 9
     b
```

As we can see, the `sum(A) = 7 < sum(B) = 9` after changing the largest number in `A` to `1`, we change change it back to `3` in `A` to make `sum(A) == sum(B)`. What's why `sum(A) < sum(B)` is also acceptable.

```kotlin
fun minOperations(nums1: IntArray, nums2: IntArray): Int {
    var sum1 = nums1.sum()
    var sum2 = nums2.sum()

    // The following implementation assumes sum1 >= sum2, so we swap them if sum1 < sum2
    if (sum1 < sum2) return minOperations(nums2, nums1)

    // We start to change from the largest and smallest number first, so we sort the array first
    nums1.sort()
    nums2.sort()

    val m = nums1.size
    val n = nums2.size
    /**
     * A = [...., largest]
     *           <-- p1
     * B = [smallest, ....]
     *         p2 -->
     */
    var p1 = m - 1
    var p2 = 0
    var diff = sum1 - sum2
    var operations = 0
    while (diff > 0) {
        if (p1 >= 0 && p2 < n) { // We have A and B to change
            if (nums1[p1] - 1 >= 6 - nums2[p2]) {
                sum1 -= (nums1[p1] - 1)
                p1--
            } else {
                sum2 += (6 - nums2[p2])
                p2++
            }
        } else if (p1 >= 0) { // We still have A, but B is out of bound
            sum1 -= (nums1[p1] - 1)
            p1--
        } else if (p2 < n) { // We still have B, but A is out of bound
            sum2 += (6 - nums2[p2])
            p2++
        } else { // There is no any number to change but the sum1 > sum2
            return -1
        }
        operations++
        diff = sum1 - sum2
    }
    return operations
}
