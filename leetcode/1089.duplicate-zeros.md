# [1089. Duplicate Zeros](https://leetcode.com/problems/duplicate-zeros/)

## Two Pointers (Extra Space)
We just copy the element from the original array to the new array, and if we found the zero, we duplicate it.
```kotlin
fun duplicateZeros(arr: IntArray) {
    var arrayIndex = 0
    var resultIndex = 0
    val arrCopy = arr.copyOf()
    while (resultIndex < arr.size) {
        arr[resultIndex] = arrCopy[arrayIndex]
        if (arrCopy[arrayIndex] == 0 && resultIndex + 1 < arr.size) {
            arr[++resultIndex] = 0
        }
        resultIndex++
        arrayIndex++
    }
}
```

* **Time Complexity**: `O(n)`, the maximum times of while loop will be the size of array.
* **Space Complexity**: `O(n)` for array copy.

## Two Pointers (Space Optimized)
1. Count zeros to know how many shifts that we need.
2. Copy the origin array element to the extended size array and duplicae zero, we **perform real copy if index is within the original size**.

```js
8,4,5,0,0,0,0,7
           <- r
8 4,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7
                   <- w
                |-----| // We don't have to write, just skip it
```

```kotlin
fun duplicateZeros(arr: IntArray): Unit {
    val n = arr.size
    var zeros = 0
    for (i in arr.indices) {
        if (arr[i] == 0) zeros++
    }
    var write = n - 1 + zeros
    for (read in n - 1 downTo 0) {
        if (arr[read] == 0) {
            // Pitfall: We need to check one by one, not just write -= 2, see below.
            // if (write >= n) {
            //     // Wrong, we will skip checking at the index `write - 1`
            //     write -= 2
            // } 
            repeat(2) {
                if (write >= n) {
                    write--
                } else {
                    arr[write--] = 0
                }
            }
        } else {
            if (write >= n) {
                write--
            } else {
                arr[write] = arr[read]
                write--
            }
        }
    }
}
```

* **Time Complexity**: `O(n)`.
* **Space Complexity**: `O(1)`, it's just in-place copy, no extra space required.

The pitfall I made is that I didn't check the index `write` one by one, so I missed the checking at the index `write - 1`:

```js
     n-1, n, n+1
...,  X], 0
          r
  w-2     w
```

If we just `write -= 2` when `arr[read] == 0` and `write` is at index `n` (out of bounds), we will miss updateing the element `X` at the index `n - 1`. Check the example `[8,4,5,0,0,0,0,7]`.
