# [2594. Minimum Time to Repair Cars](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-time-to-repair-cars/)

## Hints
- What happens to the number of cars a mechanic can repair as time increases?
- Can you check if a given time is enough to repair all cars?

## Binary Search
- **Monotonicity**: If a given time `t` is enough to repair all cars, then any larger time is also enough. If `t` is not enough, any smaller time is also not enough. This property allows us to use binary search on the answer space.
- **Lower bound**: The minimum possible time is `1`. No mechanic can repair a car in less than 1 unit of time. Or the tightest lower bound is `min(ranks) * 1`, which is the fastest mechanic to repair 1 car.
- **Upper bound**: We can assign the slowest mechanic to repair all cars, that would be `max(ranks) * cars^2`. Or the tightest upper bound is `min(ranks) * cars^2`, which is the fastest mechanic to repair all cars alone.
- **Feasibility**: For a given time, sum up `floor(sqrt(time / rank))` for each mechanic. If the total is at least the required number of cars, the time is feasible.
- **How to observe binary search applies**: The problem asks for the minimum time to satisfy a monotonic condition (repairing all cars), and the feasibility function is efficiently checkable for any candidate time. This is a classic "binary search on value" pattern.

> TODO: Understand the bounds, why the upper bound is `min(ranks) * cars^2`? And why the lower bound is `min(ranks) * 1`, can't be `min(ranks) * cars^2` or `cars`? Seem to be similar to [2187. Minimum Time to Complete Trips](../leetcode/2187.minimum-time-to-complete-trips.md)
> - The minimum time repair all the cars 最快能修好所有車？要最快我就找修車最快的師傅去修所有車就好
> - In this problem what we're trying to do is to minimise amount of time spent repairing cars. And this minimised answer can't be worse than in situation when **we allocate all of the cars to a single mechanic**.
> - It's because we are looking for the min time to complete repairing all cars, and the fastest mechanic(minRank) could potentially repair all cars alone.
> - 二分上界为 `min(ranks) * cars^2` ，即让能力值最低（修车最快）的人修好所有车所需要的时间。
> - 我们只要找到一个可行方案，这个方案都可以成为上界，然后去找更小的可行方案。所以任何一个机械工的 `ranks[i] * cars^2` 都可以是上界。然后为了使二分的次数更少，选 `min(ranks) * cars^2`。

```kotlin
fun repairCars(ranks: IntArray, cars: Int): Long {
    val cars = cars.toLong()
    var left = 1L
    var right = ranks.min() * cars * cars 
    while (left <= right) {
        val middle = left + (right - left) / 2
        val feasible = canRepareAllCars(ranks, cars, middle)
        if (feasible) {
            right = middle - 1
        } else {
            left = middle + 1
        }
    }
    return left
}

// Given a time, how many total cars can be repaired? >= cars?
private fun canRepareAllCars(ranks: IntArray, cars: Long, time: Long): Boolean {
    var repaired = 0L
    for (rank in ranks) {
        repaired += sqrt(time.toDouble() / rank).toLong()
    }
    return cars <= repaired
}
```
- **Time Complexity**: `O(n * log(maxTime))`, where `n` is the number of mechanics, and `maxTime` is the search space.
- **Space Complexity**: `O(1)`.

## Edge Cases
- Only one mechanic: all cars must be repaired by one person, so time is `rank * cars^2`.
- All mechanics have the same rank: cars are distributed as evenly as possible.
- Large values for `cars` or `ranks`: ensure no overflow (use `Long`).
- If `cars` is 1, answer is `min(ranks)`.

## WA
I set the wrong lower bound, I think all cars can be repaired in 1 time unit, but it is not true.
```kotlin
fun repairCars(ranks: IntArray, cars: Int): Long {
    val cars = cars.toLong()

    // Wrong bound
    var left = cars // I think all cars can be repaired in 1 time unit
    var right = ranks.max() * cars * cars // Showest mechanics to repair all cars
    while (left <= right) {
        val middle = left + (right - left) / 2
        val feasible = canRepareAllCars(ranks, cars, middle)
        if (feasible) {
            right = middle - 1
        } else {
            left = middle + 1
        }
    }
    return left
}

private fun canRepareAllCars(ranks: IntArray, cars: Long, time: Long): Boolean {
    // Given a time, how many total cars can be repaired? >= cars?
    var repaired = 0L
    for (rank in ranks) {
        repaired += sqrt(time.toDouble() / rank).toLong()
    }
    return cars <= repaired
}

/**

Longer time, more repaired cars: monotonic

ranks = 4, 2, 3, 1
t = 1   W, X, Y, Z < cars
...
t = 16  W, X, Y, Z >= cars
t = 17  >= cars

lower bound: showest mechanics to repair all cars
upper bound: fastest mechanics to repair all cars

Given a time, how many cars can be repaired?
