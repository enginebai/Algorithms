# [1293. Shortest Path in a Grid with Obstacles Elimination](https://leetcode.com/problems/shortest-path-in-a-grid-with-obstacles-elimination/description/)

## Hints
- What if you could not eliminate any obstacles? How would you find the shortest path?
- How can you represent the state so that you don't revisit the same cell with the same or fewer eliminations left?

## Breakdowns
> 1. How to find the shortest path from `(0, 0)` to `(m - 1, n - 1)` without any obstacle?

* Start BFS from `(0, 0)` level by leve and return answer when reach `(m - 1, n - 1)`.

> 3. How to find the shortest path from `(0, 0)` to `(m - 1, n - 1)`, there might be obstacle but no elimination?

* Same to the first question, but need to check if the next position is obstacle. Similar problem [1926. Nearest Exit from Entrance in Maze](../leetcode/1926.nearest-exit-from-entrance-in-maze.md).

## BFS
- The classic BFS for shortest path in a grid only needs to track `(x, y)` as visited, but here, the number of remaining eliminations (`k`) is also part of the state. This is because reaching the same cell with more eliminations left can lead to a better path later. This is a classic example of BFS with extra state (multi-dimensional visited array or set). (See below for more details)

### Multi-dimensional Visited States
The following are some key points to explain **why we need to record elimination for each node we visited**:

In classic BFS for shortest path in a grid, we only need to track whether a cell `(x, y)` has been visited, because reaching the same cell in fewer steps is always better. However, in this problem, the number of obstacle eliminations left (`k`) fundamentally changes the state:

* **Reaching the same cell with different numbers of eliminations left can lead to different future possibilities.**

For example, arriving at the same cell with `k = 2` (larger elimination) is strictly better than arriving with `k = 0` (less elimination), because we have more flexibility to eliminate obstacles in the remaining path, we have more chance to reach the end.

* **Paths that seem longer at first may be better in the future.**

Suppose you reach reach the same cell `(x, y)` in `5` steps with `k = 2` left, and in `3` steps with `k = 0` left. The 3-step path is shorter so far, but if the remaining path requires you to eliminate more obstacles, the 5-step path with 2 eliminations left might be your only chance to reach the end.

Therefore, the same cell with different elimination `(x, y, k)` is considered as **different nodes in our path**:
```js
     _____(x=3, y=2, k=2) -> ... -> (x=3, y=2, k=1) -> ... -> (x=3, y=2, k=0)
____/
    \_____(x=3, y=2, k=4) -> ...
```

The state in BFS must include `(x, y, k)` to allow us to explore different paths to the same cell with different elimination counts. 

#### Example & Analogy
For example, we have two paths to reach the same cell `(2, 2)`:
* Path A: Arrive in `4` steps with `k = 1` left.
* Path B: Arrive in `6` steps with `k = 3` left.

Even though Path B is longer, it has more remaining eliminations, it may be the only chance to reach the end if we need more eliminations later. **So we must consider both states as separate in our BFS**.

Think of `k` as a **resource** (like fuel). Two cars at the same location but with different fuel have different abilities to reach the destination. So we must track both location and fuel as a state. Or it’s like having a key to open doors. If you reach a room with more keys left, you’re in a better situation than if you have fewer keys.

> - 二維網格簡單求最短路徑：我們只需要紀錄 `(x, y)` 是否走過即可，因為 3 步走到 `(x, y)` 跟 5 步走到 `(x, y)` 我們肯定保留 3 步的。
> - 然而這題是二維網格有條件地求最短路徑，雖然 3 步走到 `(x, y)` 比 5 步走到 `(x, y)` 的距離短，但是 3 步走的路徑最終不一定能到終點，因為這可能是經過消除障礙而走到的，如果後續還需要消除障礙但是已經沒有次數了，該路徑雖然短但是無法抵達。所以在同一個位置上，**剩餘的消除障礙次數也是一個決定該路徑是否能走完的因素**，所以我們需要一起記錄。
> - You can reach the same cell with different numbers of remaining eliminations, and those are different states. You need to keep track of all of them. Suppose you reach cell `(i, j)` with `k = 2` eliminations left, and later you reach the same cell with `k = 0` eliminations left. The first case is better, because you have more flexibility for the rest of the path. So, you must treat these as different states.
> - If you’ve already visited `(x, y)` with `k` eliminations left, there’s no point in visiting it again with the same or fewer eliminations.
> - There is another way to keep track of visited states: `visited[x][y] = k` or `visited[x][y][k] = true`, where `k` is remaining eliminations, then if we reach the same cell with the same or fewer eliminations, we don't need to visit it again.

Good example to show same cell with different eliminations, but longer path with more eliminations could lead to better result:

1. Both A and B reach `(2, 0)`, A takes longer path, but not using elimination, B uses elimination, but it's shorter.
```js
// k = 1
0, 0, 0      A, A, A      B, 0, 0
1, 1, 0      1, 1, A      B, 1, 0
0, 0, 0  ->  A, A, A  or  B, 0, 0
0, 1, 1      0, 1, 1      0, 1, 1
0, 1, 1      0, 1, 1      0, 1, 1
0, 1, 0      0, 1, 0      0, 1, 0
```
2. When reaching `(6, 0)`, A has `k = 1` left, B has `k = 0` left. So A can still reach the end, but B can't. Even though A is longer, but it has elimination left, it has more chance to reach the end.
```js
// k = 1
0, 0, 0      A, A, A      B, 0, 0
1, 1, 0      1, 1, A      B, 1, 0
0, 0, 0  ->  A, A, A  or  B, 0, 0
0, 1, 1      A, 1, 1      B, 1, 1
0, 1, 1      A, 1, 1      B, 1, 1
0, 1, 0      A, 1, 0      B, 1, 0
```

- **Time Complexity:** `O(m * n * k)`
- **Space Complexity:** `O(m * n * k)`

## Edge Cases
- If the start or end cell is an obstacle and `k == 0`, return `-1` immediately.
- Grids with all zeros or all ones (with enough `k`).
- Multiple paths to the same cell with different remaining eliminations.
