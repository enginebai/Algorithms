# [572. Subtree of Another Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/subtree-of-another-tree/)

## Clarification Questions
* No, it's clear from problem description.
 
## Test Cases
### Normal Cases
```
Input: 
        3
       / \
      4   5
     / \
    1   2

    4
   / \
  1   2
Output: true

Input: 
        3
       / \
      4   5
     / \
    1   2

    4
   / \
  1   3
Output: false
```
### Edge / Corner Cases
* One of the trees is empty.
* The two trees are the same.
* It contains the subtree but with more nodes.
```
Input: 
        1
      /   \
     2     3
    / \     \
   4   5     6
  /
 7

    2
   / \
  4   5
Output: false, there is [7] in the tree but not in the subtree.
```

## DFS
```kotlin
fun isSubtree(root: TreeNode?, subRoot: TreeNode?): Boolean {
    if (root == null && subRoot == null) return true
    if (root == null || subRoot == null) return false

    return isSameTree(root, subRoot) || isSubtree(root?.left, subRoot) || isSubtree(root?.right, subRoot)
}

private fun isSameTree(p: TreeNode?, q: TreeNode?): Boolean {
	// Use the same implementation as [100. Same Tree](../leetcode/100.same-tree.md)
}
```
* **Time Complexity**: `O(m * n)`, where `m` and `n` represents the nodes of two trees, we have to traverse the tree (`isSubtree()`) and compare the nodes in the subtree (`isSameTree()`).
* **Space Complexity**: `O(max(m, n))`, the space is used for recursion call stack when traversing the tree.

## KMP
We can serialize the tree by DFS, then use KMP to find the subtree in the tree. Here we have to add the specific value for `null` node to avoid the ambiguity of the serialization.
