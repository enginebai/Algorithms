## [203. Remove Linked List Elements](https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-linked-list-elements/)

```js
// Delete the head, and move the head
[6, 6, 6, 1], value = 6 --> [1]

// Delete non-head node
[1, 2, 3, 3], value = 3 --> [1, 2]
```

When deleting a node, we can implement in the following way:

```kotlin
var previous: ListNode? = sentinel
var current: ListNode? = head
while (current != null) {
    if (current == nodeToDelete) {
        previous?.next = current.next
    } else {
        previous = current
        current = current.next
    }
}
```

However, the implementation will not work when delete the head, since `previous` is null and `previous?.next` will not be executed at all, we have find other way to handle the case to delete head.

We introduce *sentinel node* to help us when deleting the head node so that we can implement node deletion in the above way even for deleting head.

```kotlin
fun removeElements(head: ListNode?, `val`: Int): ListNode? {
    val sentinel = ListNode(-1)
    sentinel.next = head
    var previous: ListNode? = sentinel
    var current: ListNode? = head
    while (current != null) {
        if (current.`val` == `val`) {
            previous?.next = current.next
        } else {
            previous = current
        }
        current = current.next
    }
    return sentinel?.next
}
```
