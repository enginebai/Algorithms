# [2560. House Robber IV](https://leetcode.com/problems/house-robber-iv/description/)

## Hints
- What if you could check, for a given capability, whether it's possible to rob `k` houses with **each robbed house <= capability** and **no adjacent houses**?

## Binary Search
The key idea is to use binary search to find the smallest capability such that you can rob at least `k` non-adjacent houses. For each guess, use a greedy check to see if it's feasible.
- **Monotonicity**: If a capability is feasible, any larger capability is also feasible.
- **Lower bound**: The minimum value in `nums` (since you must rob at least one house).
- **Upper bound**: The maximum value in `nums` (in the worst case, you must rob the most expensive house).
- **Feasibility**: For a given capability, greedily try to rob as many non-adjacent houses as possible with value ≤ capability.

How do we check if a given capability is enough to rob at least `k` non-adjacent houses? Simulate robbing houses: for each house, if its value is ≤ capability and it's not adjacent to the last robbed house, rob it and skip the next. Count how many you can rob.

> -「偷走的最大金额」越小，能偷的房子就越少，反之越多。
> - 如果给定一个限制 `limit`，表示不能偷金额超过 `limit` 的房屋，则 `limit` 越大，约束越弱，肯定越容易达成偷至少`k`个不相邻的屋子。

```kotlin
fun minCapability(nums: IntArray, k: Int): Int {
    var left = nums.min().toLong()
    var right = nums.max().toLong()
    while (left <= right) {
        val middle = left + (right - left) / 2
        val feasible = check(nums, k, middle, 0) || check(nums, k, middle, 1)
        if (feasible) {
            right = middle - 1
        } else {
            left = middle + 1
        }
    }
    return left.toInt()
}

private fun check(nums: IntArray, k: Int, capability: Long, start: Int): Boolean {
    val n = nums.size
    var i = start
    var houses = 0
    while (i < n) {
        if (nums[i].toLong() <= capability) {
            i += 2
            houses++
        } else {
            i++
        }
    }
    return k <= houses
}

// Or equivalently, we just greedily rob the houses as many as possible.
// Some solutions check both starting from index 0 and 1 (parity), but this greedy 
// is sufficient since the binary search will always find the minimum feasible capability.
private fun check(nums: IntArray, k: Int, capability: Long): Boolean {
    var count = 0
    var i = 0
    while (i < nums.size) {
        if (nums[i] <= capability) {
            count++
            i += 2
        } else {
            i++
        }
    }
    return k <= count
}
```
- **Time Complexity**: `O(n log(max(nums)))` where `n` is the number of houses.
- **Space Complexity**: `O(1)`

## Edge Cases
- `k` is 1 (just need the minimum value).

## Pitfalls
- Forgetting to check both even and odd starting indices (not needed if greedy is correct, but some implementations do).
- Not should skip the next house.
