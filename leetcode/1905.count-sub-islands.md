# [1905. Count Sub Islands](https://leetcode.com/problems/count-sub-islands/description/)
 
## Traversal
We can traverse the 2nd islands and check if the cell is in the 1st island. We define `dfs()` function that returns `true` if all the cells are in the 1st island.

Please note that we don't early return in `dfs()` function, because we need to make sure all the cells are visited. See [130. Surrounded Regions](../leetcode/130.surrounded-regions.md) for more details.

```kotlin
private val directions = arrayOf(
    intArrayOf(-1, 0),
    intArrayOf(1, 0),
    intArrayOf(0, -1),
    intArrayOf(0, 1)
)

fun countSubIslands(grid1: Array<IntArray>, grid2: Array<IntArray>): Int {
    var count = 0
    val grid2Visited = HashSet<Pair<Int, Int>>()
    for (x in 0 until grid2.size) {
        for (y in 0 until grid2[0].size) {
            if (grid2[x][y] == 1 && grid2Visited.contains(x to y).not()) {
                val result = dfs(grid2, x, y, grid2Visited, grid1)
                if (result) {
                    count++
                }
            }
        }
    }
    return count
}

private fun dfs(grid2: Array<IntArray>, x: Int, y: Int, visited: HashSet<Pair<Int, Int>>, grid1: Array<IntArray>): Boolean {
    var result = true
    // We should NOT early return here, we have to make sure all the cells 
    // are visited, even if the result is false.
    // if (grid1[x][y] == 0) return false
    if (grid1[x][y] == 0) result = false
    visited.add(x to y)
    directions.forEach { d -> 
        val newX = x + d[0]
        val newY = y + d[1]
        if (newX in 0 until grid2.size && newY in 0 until grid2[0].size && grid2[newX][newY] == 1 && visited.contains(newX to newY).not()) {
            // We don't also early return here, we have to make sure all the cells visited.
            result = dfs(grid2, newX, newY, visited, grid1) && result
        }
    }
    return result
