# [934. Shortest Bridge](https://leetcode.com/problems/shortest-bridge/description/)

## Breakdowns
> 1. How to find the two islands? 

DFS or BFS to find the connected components.       

> 2. How to find the shortest path between the two islands? 

Enqueue each nodes in one island and start BFS to find the shortest path to another island.

## Traversal
We can traverse to find the first island (by DFS or BFS), then BFS to find the shortest path to the second island.
* To find the first island (by DFS or BFS), we only traverse the `1` cells, and skip the `0` and visited cells.
* To find the shortest path between the two islands, we start from the first island, and traverse the `1` and `0` cells to find the second island. And for `1` cells, it could be either the first island or the second island, we need to distinguish them.

### Pitfalls
There are some key points to consider in the implementation:
* We need to break the loop when we find the first cell of island. Otherwise, we will visit all islands, not just the first one. The following code will add cells on each 1 to the first island, including the second island.
```kotlin
val islands = Array(2) { HashSet<Pair<Int, Int>>() }
for (x in 0 until grid.size) {
    for (y in 0 until grid[0].size) {
        for (i in 0 until islands.size) {
            if (grid[x][y] == 1 && islands[i].contains(x to y).not()) {
                dfs(grid, x, y, islands[i])
            }
            // OR this's also wrong
            if (grid[x][y] == 1 && islands[0].contains(x to y).not() && islands[0].contains(x to y).not())
        }
    }
}
```

* We enqueue all cells in 1st island to the queue, and then start BFS to find the shortest path to the second island. We **need to distinguish the first island and the second island**, so we use different visited set during the BFS. (Or we can change the value of the grid to mark the visited nodes.) We lost the way to distinguish the two islands if we use the same visited set:

```kotlin
// We omit some code, just focus on the key part!!
// There are all cells in the first island in queue and visited set.
fun bfs(grid: Array<IntArray>, queue: ArrayDeque<Pair<Int, Int>>, visited: HashSet<Pair<Int, Int>>): Int {
    while (queue.isNotEmpty()) {
        ...
        val (x, y) = queue.removeFirst()
        // The first cell popped from the queue is definitly 1,
        // but it's the first island, not second island.
        // We need to distinguish the two islands.
        if (grid[x][y] == 1) return flip - 1
        for (d in directions) {
            ...
            queue.addLast(newX to newY)
            visited.add(newX to newY)
        }
    }
}
```

* If we change the grid value as visited, we need to check if the grid cell is `1` (second island) before we change it when enqueuing the nodes. (See the second implementation.)

### Using HashSet as Visited
To avoid the pitfalls, we can use two visited sets to distinguish the two islands. We use the first visited set to mark the first island when finding the first island, and then use the second visited set to mark the second island when finding the shortest path between the two islands.
```kotlin
fun shortestBridge(grid: Array<IntArray>): Int {
    val (x, y) = findStart(grid)
    val queue = ArrayDeque<Pair<Int, Int>>()
    val firstIsland = HashSet<Pair<Int, Int>>()
    dfs(grid, x, y, firstIsland, queue)
    return bfs(grid, queue, firstIsland)
}

private fun findStart(grid: Array<IntArray>): Pair<Int, Int> {
    for (x in 0 until grid.size) {
        for (y in 0 until grid[0].size) {
            if (grid[x][y] == 1) return x to y
        }
    }
    // dummy return
    return -1 to -1
}

// General DFS function to find the first island, we traverse only the first island.
// Skip out of bound, visited, and water cells.
private fun dfs(grid: Array<IntArray>, x: Int, y: Int, visited: HashSet<Pair<Int, Int>>, queue: ArrayDeque<Pair<Int, Int>>) {
    val m = grid.size
    val n = grid[0].size
    if (x !in 0 until m || y !in 0 until n) return
    if (visited.contains(x to y)) return
    if (grid[x][y] != 1) return

    visited.add(x to y)
    queue.addLast(x to y)

    directions.forEach { d ->
        val newX = x + d[0]
        val newY = y + d[1]
        dfs(grid, newX, newY, visited, queue)
    }
}

// We start from all cells in the first island, flip and find the shortest path to the second island.
private fun bfs(grid: Array<IntArray>, queue: ArrayDeque<Pair<Int, Int>>, firstIsland: HashSet<Pair<Int, Int>>): Int {
    val n = grid.size
    val flipSet = HashSet<Pair<Int, Int>>()
    var flip = 0
    while (queue.isNotEmpty()) {
        val size = queue.size
        repeat(size) {
            val (x, y) = queue.removeFirst()
            // Here is the key part to distinguish the two islands: Check if it's not the first island.
            // flip - 1 for the end cell.
            if (grid[x][y] == 1 && firstIsland.contains(x to y).not()) return flip - 1

            for (d in directions) {
                val newX = x + d[0]
                val newY = y + d[1]
                if (newX !in 0 until n) continue
                if (newY !in 0 until n) continue
                if (firstIsland.contains(newX to newY)) continue
                if (flipSet.contains(newX to newY)) continue

                // The cell might be 0 or 1 (second island)
                queue.addLast(newX to newY)
                flipSet.add(newX to newY)
            }
        }
        flip++
    }
    return flip
}
```

* **Time Complexity:** `O(n^2)`.
* **Space Complexity:** `O(n^2)`.

### Changing the Grid Value as Visited
```kotlin
private val firstIsland = -1
private val flipIsland = -2

fun shortestBridge(grid: Array<IntArray>): Int {
    val (x, y) = findStart(grid)
    val queue = ArrayDeque<Pair<Int, Int>>()
    dfs(grid, x, y, queue)
    return bfs(grid, queue)
}

private fun findStart(grid: Array<IntArray>): Pair<Int, Int> {
    for (x in 0 until grid.size) {
        for (y in 0 until grid[0].size) {
            if (grid[x][y] == 1) return x to y
        }
    }
    // dummy return
    return -1 to -1
}

private fun dfs(grid: Array<IntArray>, x: Int, y: Int, queue: ArrayDeque<Pair<Int, Int>>) {
    val m = grid.size
    val n = grid[0].size
    if (x !in 0 until m || y !in 0 until n) return
    if (grid[x][y] != 1) return

    grid[x][y] = firstIsland
    queue.addLast(x to y)

    directions.forEach { d ->
        val newX = x + d[0]
        val newY = y + d[1]
        dfs(grid, newX, newY, queue)
    }
}

private fun bfs(grid: Array<IntArray>, queue: ArrayDeque<Pair<Int, Int>>): Int {
    val n = grid.size
    var flip = 0
    while (queue.isNotEmpty()) {
        val size = queue.size
        repeat(size) {
            val (x, y) = queue.removeFirst()
            // This is wrong answer when we mark the node as visited after we add it to the queue, we lose the original value of the grid:
            // if (grid[x][y] == 1) reteurn flip - 1

            for (d in directions) {
                val newX = x + d[0]
                val newY = y + d[1]
                if (newX !in 0 until n) continue
                if (newY !in 0 until n) continue
                if (grid[newX][newY] == firstIsland || grid[newX][newY] == flipIsland) continue

                // We check if we reach the second island when we enqueue the adjacent nodes.
                if (grid[newX][newY] == 1) return flip

                // We enqueue the next node and mark it as visited. Here we lose the original value of the grid.
                queue.addLast(newX to newY)
                grid[newX][newY] = this.flipIsland
            }
        }
        flip++
    }
    return flip
}
```
