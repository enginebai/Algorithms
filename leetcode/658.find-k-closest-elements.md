# [658. Find K Closest Elements](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-k-closest-elements/description/)

## Clarification Questions
* `k` range?
* Does `x` always exist in the array?
 
## Test Cases
### Normal Cases
```
Input: arr = [1,2,3,4,5], k = 1, x = 2
Output: [1,2,3]
```
### Edge / Corner Cases
* `x` does not exist in the array.
```
Input: arr = [-1,1,2,4,5,6], k = 4, x = 3
Output: [1,2,4,5]
```
* There are some number with the same distance between `x`.
```
Input: arr = [-1,2,3,4,5], k = 2, x = 3
Output: [2,3]
```

## Pitfalls
The problem is asking `k` closest integers to `x`, however, `x` may not be in the array, so we can't just find the index of `x` and expand the range to find the `k` closest integers.
```js
   [y y X y y y y y y y]
|------ k ------|

    X  [y y y y y y y y y y]
|-- k --|
```

## Heap
Just sort by the distance of `x`, and find the k closest (k smallest) elements.

```kotlin
fun findClosestElements(arr: IntArray, k: Int, x: Int): List<Int> {
    // To find `k` smallest elements, we can use a max heap of fixed size `k`.
    val maxHeap = PriorityQueue<Int>() { n1, n2 -> 
        val d1 = abs(x - n1)
        val d2 = abs(x - n2)

        if (d1 == d2) n2 - n1
        else d2 - d1
    }
    for (n in arr) {
        maxHeap.add(n)
        if (maxHeap.size > k) {
            maxHeap.poll()
        }
    }
    val results = mutableListOf<Int>()
    while (maxHeap.isNotEmpty()) {
        results.add(maxHeap.poll())
    }
    results.sort()
    return results
}
```

* **Time Complexity**: `O(n * lg k + k * lg k)`.
* **Space Complexity**: `O(k)`.

### Two Pointers (Binary Search)
**Idea!!** We're looking for the window size is `k` and we initialize the window size as array size, then we try to shrink the window size to `k`.

We set two points at the first and last position, and check the distance of `x` with the two points, then shrink the range of longer distance until the size is `k`. If the distance is equal, then we shrink the right pointer because of this rule: `|a - x| == |b - x| and a < b` in the problem description.

```kotlin
fun findClosestElements(arr: IntArray, k: Int, x: Int): List<Int> {
    var left = 0
    var right = arr.size - 1
    while (right - left + 1 > k) { // Equivalent to `while ((right - left) >= k)`
        val leftDiff = abs(arr[left] - x)
        val rightDiff = abs(arr[right] - x)
        if (leftDiff > rightDiff) left++
        else right--
    }
    return arr.slice(left..right)
}

/**
 Why `right - left >= k` works? It will stop when `right - left == k - 1` which is equivalent to `right - left + 1 == k`.
 */
```

* **Time Complexity**: `O(n)`.
* **Space Complexity**: `O(k)` for results.

### Test Cases
```js
[1, 2, 5, 7, 10] k = 1, 2, 4; x = -1, 4, 6
```
