# [759. Employee Free Time](https://leetcode.com/problems/employee-free-time/description/)

## Problem
We are given a list `schedule` of employees, which represents the working time for each employee.

Each employee has a list of non-overlapping `Intervals`, and these intervals are in sorted order.

Return the list of finite intervals representing **common, positive-length free time** for *all* employees, also in sorted order.

(Even though we are representing `Intervals` in the form `[x, y]`, the objects inside are `Intervals`, not lists or arrays. For example, `schedule[0][0].start = 1`, `schedule[0][0].end = 2`, and `schedule[0][0][0]` is not defined). Also, we wouldn't include intervals like [5, 5] in our answer, as they have zero length.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: schedule = [[[1,2],[5,6]],[[1,3]],[[4,10]]]
Output: [[3,4]]
Explanation: There are a total of three employees, and all common
free time intervals would be [-inf, 1], [3, 4], [10, inf].
We discard any intervals that contain inf as they aren't finite.

```js
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 0, 1
|--|        |--|
1, 0 -1  0  1  0 -1  0  0  0  0
|-----| 
2, 0 -1 -1  1  0 -1  0  0  0  0
         |-----------------|
2, 0 -1  0  1  0 -1  0  0  0 -1
2  2  1  1  2  2  1  1  1  1  0
      ^^^^
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: schedule = [[[1,3],[6,7]],[[2,4]],[[2,5],[9,12]]]
Output: [[5,6],[7,9]]
```

```js
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 0, 1, 2, 3
|-----|        |--|
1  0  0 -1  0  1  0 -1  0  0  0  0, 0
   |-----|
1  1  0 -1 -1  1  0 -1  0  0  0  0, 0
   |--------|           |--------|
1  2  0 -1 -1  0  0 -1  1  0  0  0 -1

1  3  3  2  1  1  1  0  1  1  1  1  0
            ^^^^  ^^^^^^^
            
```

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= schedule.length , schedule[i].length <= 50`
- `0 <= schedule[i].start < schedule[i].end <= 10^8`
