# [2064. Minimized Maximum of Products Distributed to Any Store](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimized-maximum-of-products-distributed-to-any-store/description/)

## Test Cases
### Edge / Corner Cases
* `n == 1` or `n == sum(quantities)`.
```
Input: n = 1, quantities = [100]
Output: 100

Input: n = 10, quantities = [1, 2, 3, 4]
Output: 1
```

## Binary Search
There are some key constraints in the problem:
1. We need to distribute **all products** to `n` stores.
3. We can distribute different amount of products to each store.
2. We distribute only single type of product to each store.

If the number of stores is `n == len(quantities)`, each store gets the whole product in one type, then the answer would be `max(quantities)`:
```js
n = 2
quantities = [6, 11]
stores        A   B

Store A: [6]
Store B: [11] * the maximum

n = 4
quantities = [6, 8, 3, 2]
stores        A  B  C  D
```

For the larger number of stores `n == sum(quantities)` or even more stores that `n > sum(quantities)`, then the answer would be `1`:
```js
n = 17
quantities = [6, 11]

// Distributions
[1],[1], ... ,[1]

n = 100
quantities = [1]
[1],[0], ... , [0], ... ,[0]
```

This forms a **fixed search space** for the answer, `[1, max(quantities)]`:
* Lower bound is `1`, we must distribute at least one product to stores. (Some stores may get `0` products if there is not enough products to distribute)
* Upper bound is the `max(quantities)`, because we can distribute all products of single type to one store.

----
To minimize the maximum, we should distribute the products as evenly as possible amoung the stores. Given an amount for each store, we can distribute products of the same type in **greedy** way so that it's evenly distributed to minimize maximum.

For `quantities=[6, 11]` products and `n = 6`, we can calculate how many number of stores that are **required to distribute all products** with that amount:
* amount = `11`, we need `2` stores to distribute all products `[6] / [11]`.
* amount = `6`, we need `3` stores to distribute all products `[6] / [6, 5]`.
* amount = `3`, we need `6` stores `[3, 3] / [3, 3, 3, 2]`.
* amount = `2`, we need `9` stores `[2, 2, 2] / [2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1]`.
* amount = `1`, we need `17` stores `[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1] / [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`.

As the amount to distribute decreases, the total required number of store increases. we can distribute with a given amount `x`, then we can also distribute with the larger `x + 1`, `x + 2`, ... If we can't distribute with a given amount `x`, then we also can't distribute with the smaller `x - 1`, `x - 2`, ... amount. It's the **monotonicity** we can apply binary search in this problem. 

```js
n = 6
amount = 1, 2, 3, 6, 11
stores = 17 9, 6, 3, 2  // stores count <= 6
         X  X  O  O  O
               ^
               the minimum amount to distribute all products to n stores
```

We binary search the first number that satisfies the condition `storeCount <= n` in the range `[1, max]`.

### Why Allowing `storeCount < n`?
Let's take example from above: `amount = 11`, we need `2 < 6` stores to distribute all products `[6] / [11]`. This is allowed to explore further in the search space
 because we can still reduce the amount until we can distribute all products to `n` stores. (as amount decreases, storeCount increases)

> 要讓每間店拿到最大的商品數最小化，那麼一定是商品的數量會很均勻的分配，而不會出現說 `[1, 8]`，而應該是 `[4, 5]`，這樣才讓最大值最小化。我們尋找的是商品分配的最大值，二分搜尋的就是這個最大值，二分的過程當中給定一個值，判斷能不能分配這個數量給店家，如果可以就在縮小搜尋範圍，而 **這個過程使用貪心策略就已經滿足了均勻分配的條件，就已經滿足最大化最小值**。

> 我們可以在一個範圍內搜尋這個最大值，並使用二分搜尋來逐步縮小範圍。

```kotlin
fun minimizedMaximum(n: Int, quantities: IntArray): Int {
    var max = Int.MIN_VALUE
    for (q in quantities) {
        max = maxOf(max, q)
    }
    var left = 1
    var right = max
    while (left <= right) {
        val middle = left + (right - left) / 2
        if (canDistributed(n, quantities, middle)) {
            right = middle - 1
        } else {
            left = middle + 1
        }
    }
    return left
}

    }

    /**

     *
     * For example, [6, 11] and n = 6, we can distribute all products in this way:
     * [6] / [11] / [] / [] / [] / []. The storeCount will be 2 < 6, in this case, we can

     */
    return storeCount <= n
}
```

* **Time Complexity:** `O(n * log(max(quantities)))`, where `n` is the size of the quantities array.
* **Space Complexity:** `O(1)`.
