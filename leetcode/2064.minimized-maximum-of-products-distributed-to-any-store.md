# [2064. Minimized Maximum of Products Distributed to Any Store](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimized-maximum-of-products-distributed-to-any-store/description/)

要讓每間店拿到最大的商品數最小化，那麼一定是商品的數量會很均勻的分配，而不會出現說 `[1, 8]`，而應該是 `[4, 5]`，這樣才讓最大值最小化。
我們尋找的是商品分配的最大值，二分搜尋的就是這個最大值，二分的過程當中給定一個值，判斷能不能分配這個數量給店家，如果可以就在縮小搜尋範圍，而 **這個過程使用貪心策略就已經滿足了均勻分配的條件，就已經滿足最大化最小值**。
我們可以在一個範圍內搜尋這個最大值，並使用二分搜尋來逐步縮小範圍。

To minimize the maximum, we should distribute the products as evenly as possible amoung the stores. Given an amount for each store, we can distribute products of the same type in greedy way so that it's evenly distributed to minimize maximum.

For `quantities=[6, 11]` products and `n = 6`, we can calculate the stores count to distribute all products with different amount:
* amount = `11`, we need `2` stores to distribute all products `[6] / [11]`, we can distribute all products to `n` stores, it's OK.
* amount = `6`, we need `3` stores to distribute all products `[6] / [6, 5]`, it's OK.
* amount = `3`, we need `6` stores `[3, 3] / [3, 3, 3, 2]`, it's OK.
* amount = `2`, we need `9` stores `[2, 2, 2] / [2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1]`, it's not OK.
* amount = `1`, we need `17` stores `[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1] / [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`, it's not OK.

**As the amount decreases, the stores count to distribute all products increases.** And suppose we can distribute all products to `n` stores with a given amount `x`, then we can also distribute all products to `n` stores with the larger `x + 1`, `x + 2`, ... If we can't distribute all products to `n` stores with a given amount `x`, then we also can't distribute all products to `n` stores with the smaller `x - 1`, `x - 2`, ... amount. It's the monotonicity we can apply binary search in this problem.

```js
amount = 1, 2, 3, 6, 11
stores = 17 9, 6, 3, 2  // stores count <= 6
         X  X  O  O  O
               ^
               the minimum amount to distribute all products to n stores
```

The possible range of amount is:
* Lower bound is `1`, we distribute at least one product to each store.
* Upper bound is the maximum amount in the input array, because we can distribute all products of single type to one store. 

We can binary search the smallest amount that can distribute all products to `n` stores. (`store count <= n`) in the range `[1, max]`.

```kotlin
fun minimizedMaximum(n: Int, quantities: IntArray): Int {
    var max = Int.MIN_VALUE
    for (q in quantities) {
        max = maxOf(max, q)
    }
    var left = 1
    var right = max
    while (left <= right) {
        val middle = left + (right - left) / 2
        if (canDistributed(n, quantities, middle)) {
            right = middle - 1
        } else {
            left = middle + 1
        }
    }
    return left
}

/**
 * We check if we can distribute all product with a given maximum amount,
 * we calculate how many stores we need to distribute all products? We use 
 * greedy algorithm to distribute products.
 */
private fun canDistributed(n: Int, quantities: IntArray, amount: Int): Boolean {
    var storeCount = 0
    for (q in quantities) {
        storeCount += q / amount
        if (q % amount != 0) storeCount++
    }

    /**
     * It's ok that storeCount < n, it means that the distribution of some store are empty
     * and it's acceptable. (from problem description: "After distribution, each store will 
     * have been given some number of products (possibly 0)."
     *
     * For example, [6, 11] and n = 6, we can distribute all products in this way:
     * [6] / [11] / [] / [] / [] / []. The storeCount will be 2 < 6, in this case, we can
     * still distribute all products to 6 stores.
     */
    return storeCount <= n
}
```

* **Time Complexity:** `O(n * log(max(quantities)))`, where `n` is the size of the quantities array.
* **Space Complexity:** `O(1)`.
