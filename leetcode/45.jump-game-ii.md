# [45. Jump Game II](https://leetcode.com/problems/jump-game-ii/)

## Greedy
**Idea!!** To get the minimum jump, we have to jump as far as we can for every jump. So we have to track the farthest index that we can reach, and jump greedily. Once we reach the farthest index, we have to jump again, and we update the farthest index to the new farthest index that we can reach. 

We have to track several variables:
1. `farthest`: The farthest index that we can reach.
2. `jumps`: The minimum number of jump. (Answer)
3. `current`: The current position that we are at.

We iterate all numbers (except the last one), and update `farthest` greedily, if we reach the `current`, we have to jump, so we update `current` to `farthest` and increase `jumps`.

```js
index = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
nums  = 2, 0, 3, 0, 0, _
        *-----|             // farthest: update to 0 + 2 = 2
        c1    c2            // current: jump from c1 to c2
        i                   // iterator
        jumps = 0 -> 1       // we have to jump here
      
index = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
nums  = 2, 0, 3, 0, 0, _
              |             
              c            
           i                  
        jumps = 1

index = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
nums  = 2, 0, 3, 0, 0, _
              *--------|             
              c2       c3            
              i                  
              jumps = 1 -> 2

index = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
nums  = 2, 0, 3, 0, 0, _
                       |             
                       c            
                 i                  
              jumps = 2

// and so on until i == n - 2
```

```kotlin
fun jump(nums: IntArray): Int {
    var farthest = 0
    var jumps = 0
    var current = 0
    // Iterate all numbers except the last one
    for (i in 0 until nums.size - 1) {
        farthest = maxOf(farthest, i + nums[i])
        // We have to increment jump
        if (current <= i) {
            jumps++
            // We jump as far as we can (greedily)
            current = farthest
        }
    }
    return jumps
}
```

* **Time Complexity**: `O(n)`.
* **Space Complexity**: `O(1)`.

## Interval
> It's the same idea as above, but we use interval to interpret the problem.
We can also use interval to solve this problem: Each index `i` represent the interval `[i, i + nums[i]]`, and we try to cover the whole array with the minimum number of intervals.


```js
0 .................. n - 1
i
|-----| // Use the first interval
      i // Move to the end of the first interval

0______ ............ n - 1
      i
      // Pick the interval that have intersection with the current interval
  |-----|
    |--------| <--- Choose the interval that can reach the farthest
     |-----|

            |-----|  // It's the farthest interval that we can reach, but we can't choose because it has no intersection with the current interval

0_____________...... n - 1
             i

// and so on until i == n - 2
```

## BFS
For each position, the range we can jump is `[i, i + nums[i]]`, we explore all reachable positions in that range, try to find the farthest position that we can reach, and we jump to that position. We use two pointers `L` and `R` to represent the current interval that we are considering, and we try to extend the interval as far as we can.

```js
0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10
2, X, X, X, X, X, X, X, X, X, X
i
LR // [0, 0 + 2]
*----->

// Jump from 0 to 2
0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10
2, X, 3, 4, 5, 3, X, X, X, X, X
      i
      L--------R // [2, 2 + 3]
         *-----------> 
            *--------------> // farthest
               *-------->

// Jump from 2 to 9
0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10
2, X, 3, 4, 5, 3, X, X, X, 3, 1
                           i
                           L--------R // [9, 9 + 3], farthest
                              *--> 

// Jump from 9 to 12
0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10
2, X, 3, 4, 5, 3, X, X, X, 3, 1
                                    i // reach the end

```

```kotlin
fun jump(nums: IntArray): Int {
    var jumps = 0
    var current = 0
    var left = 0
    var right = 0
    // We have to jump until we can reach the last position
    while (right < nums.size - 1) {
        // Try to extend the farthest index that we can reach
        var farthest = 0
        for (i in left..right) {
            farthest = maxOf(farthest, i + nums[i])
        }
        // Jump to the farthest position, then start to explore the next interval
        left = right
        right = farthest
        jumps++
    }
    return jumps
}
```

* **Space Complexity**: `O(1)`.

## Dynamic Programming
> It's not the optimal solution, might skip it.

Suppose `dp[i]` represent the minimum numbers of jump, then we start BFS from every position to update `dp[i]`.

```js
index = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4
nums  = 2, 4, 0, 1, 2
dp[i] = 0, *, *, *, * // * = positive infinite
        i
           j  j

// From index i, we can reach j = 0 + 1, 0 + 2, so we update dp[j].
nums  = 2, 4, 0, 1, 2
dp[i] = 0, 1, 1, *, *
           i
              j  j  j

nums  = 2, 4, 0, 1, 2
dp[i] = 0, 1, 1, 2, 2
```

```kotlin
fun jump(nums: IntArray): Int {
    if (nums.size == 1) return 0
    val dp = IntArray(nums.size) { Int.MAX_VALUE }
    dp[0] = 0
    for (i in 0 until nums.size) {
        for (j in i + 1..min(i + nums[i], nums.size - 1)) {
            if (dp[i] != Int.MAX_VALUE)
                dp[j] = min(dp[j], dp[i] + 1)
        }
    }
    return dp[nums.size - 1]
}
```

* **Time Complexity**: `O(n^2)`.
* **Space Complexity**: `O(n)`.
