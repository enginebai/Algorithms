# [1760. Minimum Limit of Balls in a Bag](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-limit-of-balls-in-a-bag/description/)

## Hints
- What happens to the number of operations if you decrease the allowed maximum size of a bag?
- Can you check if a given maximum size is feasible in `O(n)`?

## Breakdowns
> 1. Can we check if a given maximum size is feasible with at most `maxOperations` splits?

Try simulating the process: for each bag, how many splits are needed to make all resulting bags ≤ the given size?

## Key Insights
> NOTE: `penalty` is the maximum size of the bag.

- The key is to realize that as the allowed `penalty` decreases, we need more splits, the number of required operations (splits) increases. This is a classic monotonic property.
- If the total operations needed is ≤ `maxOperations`, then `penalty` is feasible. If not, we need to increase `penalty` to make it feasible.
- For a given `penalty`, the number of operations needed is the sum over all bags of `parts - 1`, which is `ceil(num / penalty) - 1`. This counts how many splits are needed for each bag to ensure all resulting bags are ≤ `penalty`:

```js
penalty = 3
 8 = [3, 3, 2]          3 - 1
 9 = [3, 3, 3]          3 - 1
10 = [3, 3, 3, 1]       4 - 1
11 = [3, 3, 3, 2]       4 - 1
12 = [3, 3, 3, 3]       4 - 1
13 = [3, 3, 3, 3, 1]    5 - 1
```

As above example, 13 needs 5 parts `ceil(13 / 3) = 5`, it needs 4 operations. 

> Alternative way to calculate the splits: `(num - 1) / penalty`, this avoids floating point casting and is more efficient than using `ceil(num / penalty) - 1`.
> 怎麼計算分割的次數？不用卡在想中間要怎麼分，你就直接想 `X` 一直切一塊 `penalty` 直到剩下的小於 `penality` 或者剛好切完。舉例：
> - `8` 切一塊 `3` 剩下 `5`，一次。
> - `5` 切一塊 `3` 剩下 `2`，二次。 `2 < 3` 結束!

## Binary Search
- **Monotonicity**: If a penalty is feasible, any larger penalty is also feasible. If not, any smaller penalty is not feasible.
- **Lower bound**: `1`, we split as much as possible.
- **Upper bound**: `max(nums)` (no split).
- **Feasibility**: Given a `penality`, can we split the balls so that maximum of all balls ≤ `penality` and operations ≤ `maxOperations`?

```kotlin
fun minimumSize(nums: IntArray, maxOperations: Int): Int {
    val maxOperations = maxOperations.toLong()
    var left = 1L
    var right = nums.max().toLong()
    while (left <= right) {
        val middle = left + (right - left) / 2
        val feasible = check(nums, maxOperations, middle)
        if (feasible) {
            right = middle - 1
        } else {
            left = middle + 1
        }
    }
    return left.toInt()
}

private fun check(nums: IntArray, maxOperations: Long, max: Long): Boolean {
    var operations = 0L
    for (num in nums) {
        val parts = ceil(num * 1.0 / max).toInt()
        operations += parts - 1
    }
    return operations <= maxOperations
}
```

- **Time Complexity**: `O(n * log(max(nums)))`, where `n` is the number of bags.
- **Space Complexity**: `O(1)`.

## Edge Cases
- All bags are already ≤ the answer: No operation needed.
- `maxOperations` is 0: The answer is `max(nums)`.
- **Large values in `nums`**: Use integer division to avoid overflow and floating point errors.
- Only one bag: The answer is `ceil(num / (maxOperations + 1))`.

## WA
My original idea is `9` = `[8,1] / [7,2] / [6,3] / [5,4]`, `num / 2` leads optimal split.

But splitting into equal halves is not optimal, for example, `9 -> [4, 5] -> [2, 2, 5] -> [2, 2, 2, 3]` which needs 3 operations. But `9 -> [6, 3] -> [3, 3, 3]` which needs 2 operations that is optimal.

```kotlin
private fun checkWA(nums: IntArray, maxOperations: Long, max: Long): Boolean {
    var operations = 0L
    val maxHeap = PriorityQueue(reverseOrder<Int>())
    for (num in nums) {
        maxHeap.add(num)
    }
    /** 
    Give a number, how many operations are needed to split num <= max
    9 -> [5, 4] -> [2, 3, 4] -> [2, 3, 2, 2]

    7 -> [4, 3] -> [2, 2, 3]
    num / 2

    [2, 4, 8, 2]

    
    */ 
    while (maxHeap.peek() > max) {
        val num = maxHeap.poll()
        val half = num / 2
        maxHeap.add(half)
        maxHeap.add(num - half)
        operations++
        if (operations > maxOperations) return false
    }
    return operations <= maxOperations
}
```
