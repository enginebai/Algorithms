# [2492. Minimum Score of a Path Between Two Cities](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-score-of-a-path-between-two-cities/description/)

## DFS or BFS
As there is at least one path between 1 and n (from the problem description) and we can go and return back, so we just find out all the edges that can be reached from node 1 and return the minimum edge.

```kotlin
class Solution {
    fun minScore(n: Int, roads: Array<IntArray>): Int {
        val graph = buildGraph(roads)
        return dfs(graph, 1, Int.MAX_VALUE, -1, n)
    }

    private fun dfs(graph: HashMap<Int, HashSet<IntArray>>, current: Int, distance: Int, parent: Int, n: Int): Int {
        if (current == parent) return Int.MAX_VALUE
        if (current == n) return distance

        var minDistance = distance
        graph[current]?.forEach { adjArr -> 
            val adj = adjArr[0]
            val nextDistance = adjArr[1]
            if (adj != parent) {
                minDistance = minOf(minDistance, dfs(graph, adj, nextDistance, current, n))
            }
        }
        return minDistance
    }

    private fun buildGraph(roads: Array<IntArray>): HashMap<Int, HashSet<IntArray>> {
        val graph = HashMap<Int, HashSet<IntArray>>()
        for (r in roads) {
            val a = r[0]
            val b = r[1]
            val d = r[2]
            if (graph.containsKey(a).not()) graph[a] = HashSet<IntArray>()
            if (graph.containsKey(b).not()) graph[b] = HashSet<IntArray>()
            graph[a]!!.add(intArrayOf(b, d))
            graph[b]!!.add(intArrayOf(a, d))
        }
        return graph
    }
}

How to handle visited?
How to handle different connected components which does not contain `n` node?
