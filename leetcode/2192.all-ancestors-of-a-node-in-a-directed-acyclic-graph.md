# [2192. All Ancestors of a Node in a Directed Acyclic Graph](https://leetcode.com/problems/all-ancestors-of-a-node-in-a-directed-acyclic-graph/description/)

> NOTE: (Problem description) Return a list answer, where `answer[i]` is the list of ancestors of the `ith` node, **sorted in ascending order**.

## DFS on Reversed Graph
The path `u -> ... -> v` indicates `u` is ancestor of `v`, and `answer[current]` = all ancestors of `current` node, which is all the nodes that can reach `current`.

For the graph `{U -> V}`, `U` is an ancestor of `V`. We can build a reversed graph `{V -> U}` and do a DFS from each node (`V`) to find all ancestors (`U`), all the visited node druing the DFS are ancestors of the current node.

## DFS on Original Graph
Node `0` is ancestor of which nodes? Start a DFS (or BFS) from node `0` as source, and all the reachable nodes will have `0` as ancestor.


We iteate each node as ascentor, and do a DFS to find all descendants of the current node, add the current node to all descendants.

![](../media/2192.all-ancestors-of-a-node-in-a-directed-acyclic-graph-2.png)

```js
dfs(0) // add 0 to all descendants: adding 0 to a, b, c
    dfs(a)
    dfs(b)
    dfs(c)
dfs(1) // add 1 to all descendants: adding 1 to a, c, x
    dfs(a)
    dfs(c)
    dfs(x)
...
dfs(n - 1)
    ...
```

```kotlin
fun getAncestors(n: Int, edges: Array<IntArray>): List<List<Int>> {
    val graph = buildGraph(edges)
    val answer = mutableListOf<MutableList<Int>>()
    for (i in 0 until n) {
        answer.add(mutableListOf<Int>())
    }
    for (ancestor in 0 until n) {
        val visited = HashSet<Int>()
        dfs(graph, ancestor, ancestor, visited, answer)
    }
    return answer
}

private fun dfs(graph: HashMap<Int, HashSet<Int>>, ancestor: Int, current: Int, visited: HashSet<Int>, answer: MutableList<MutableList<Int>>) {
    visited.add(current)
    graph[current]?.forEach { adj -> 
        if (visited.contains(adj).not()) {
            answer[adj].add(ancestor)
            dfs(graph, ancestor, adj, visited, answer)
        }

        val to = e[1]
        if (graph.containsKey(from).not()) graph[from] = HashSet<Int>()
        graph[from]!!.add(to)
    }

## Topological Sort
A *topological sort* of a directed acyclic graph (DAG) is a *linear ordering* of all vertices such that `x -> y` which `x` is the ancestor of `y`. We can use topological sort to find all ancestors of a node.

In the topological order, all the ancestors of the node `i` are the nodes that come before `i` in the topological order. (0 ~ i - 1)

```js
// If we have a graph and topological order:
topological order: [0 -> 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4]

// Then the ancestors of node 2 are 0 and 1
answer[0] = []
answer[1] = [0]
answer[2] = [0, 1]
answer[3] = [0, 1, 2]
answer[4] = [0, 1, 2, 3]
```

```kotlin
fun getAncestors(n: Int, edges: Array<IntArray>): List<List<Int>> {
    val indegree = IntArray(n)
    val adjacentList = Array<MutableList<Int>>(n) { mutableListOf<Int>() }
    for (edge in edges) {
        val from = edge[0]
        val to = edge[1]
        indegree[to]++
        adjacentList[from].add(to)
    }

    val queue = ArrayDeque<Int>()
    // We use set to store the ancestors to avoid duplicates
    val topologicalOrder = Array<HashSet<Int>>(n) { HashSet<Int>() }
    for (i in 0 until n) {
        if (indegree[i] == 0) queue.addLast(i)
    }

    while (queue.isNotEmpty()) {
        val parent = queue.removeFirst()
        adjacentList[parent].forEach { adj ->
            // A -> B -> C -> D
            //           ^ parent
            //                ^ adj
            // Then C is ancestor of D, and all ancestors of C are ancestors of D
            // See above example
            // O(n^2)
            topologicalOrder[adj].add(parent)
            topologicalOrder[adj].addAll(topologicalOrder[parent])

            if (--indegree[adj] == 0) queue.addLast(adj)
        }
    }

    val answer = mutableListOf<MutableList<Int>>()
    for (i in 0 until n) {
        // We convert the topological order to a sorted list by using `TreeSet`
        answer.add(ArrayList(TreeSet(topologicalOrder[i])))
    }
    return answer
}
```
* **Time Complexity:** `O(n^2 + n + m)` where `n` is the number of nodes and `m` is the number of edges.
    * `O(n + m)` to find the topological order.
    * `O(n^2)` to add all ancestors to the topological order.
* **Space Complexity:** `O(n^2 + n + m)`.
    * `O(n + m)` for the graph.
    * `O(n)` for the topological order.
    * `O(n^2)` for topological order of all nodes.
