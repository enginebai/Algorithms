# [1010. Pairs of Songs With Total Durations Divisible by 60](https://leetcode.com/problems/pairs-of-songs-with-total-durations-divisible-by-60/)

## Enumeration
For the two numbers `x` and `y`, if `x mod 60 == 23` and `y mod 60 == 37`, then `x + y mod 60 == 0`. This means that we can use the remainder of the numbers to find pairs that sum up to a multiple of 60. Special case is when `x mod 60 == 0`, we need to find `y mod 60 == 0` as well.

We keep track of a frequency map of remainder mod 60, and count how many times each remainder appears.

```kotlin
fun numPairsDivisibleBy60(time: IntArray): Int {
    var pairs = 0
    val count = IntArray(60)
    for (i in time.indices) {
        val remainder = time[i] % 60
        if (remainder == 0) { // Special case
            pairs += count[remainder]
        } else {
            pairs += count[60 - remainder]
        }
        count[remainder]++
    }
    return pairs
}
```
