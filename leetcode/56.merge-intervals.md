## [56. Merge Intervals](https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-intervals/)

The idea is that we sort the array first by the `start`, so that we can iterate every interval and merge one by one:
* We assign the first interval to `merged`.
* For each interval, we check if it's overlapped with `merged`, if so, we merge them.
* If not, we add the `merged` to the result and assign the current interval to `merged`.

```js
// Sort by start
[[1, 3], [2, 6], [8, 10], [15, 18]]
 merged  toMerge
         [1, 6], [8, 10], [15, 18]]
                 toMerge
                 [1, 10], [15, 18]]
                          toMerge

// After merging
[1, 10], [15, 18]
```

For two intervals `merged` and `toMerge`, there are four cases:
* **Fully Overlapped**: To merge.
* **Partially Overlapped**: To merge.
* **Adjacent**: It's still overlapped, to merge.
* **No Overlap**: To keep both, `[x, y]` and `[z, w]` => `[x, y]` and `[z, w]`, and move to the next interval.

To merge the two intervals, we just need to keep the smaller `start` and the larger `end`, that is `min(merged[0], toMerge[0]), max(merged[1], toMerge[1])`

```js
// Fully Overlapped, just keep the longer interval [1, 4]
[1      4]
   [2 3]
   // Or
   [2 3]
[1      4]

// Partially Overlapped, merged, [1, 5]
[1      4]
     [3    5]
// Or
     [3    5]
[1      4]

// Adjacent, extended, [1, 5]
[1      4][4 5]

// No Overlap, keep both, [1, 4][6, 8]
[1      4]   [6   8]
```

```kotlin
fun merge(intervals: Array<IntArray>): Array<IntArray> {
    Arrays.sort(intervals) { i1, i2 -> i1[0] - i2[0] }

    val results = mutableListOf<IntArray>()
    var merged = intervals[0]
    // Remember to add the merged interval to results first (or later)
    results.add(merged)
    for (i in 1 until intervals.size) {
        val toMerge = intervals[i]
        // Overlapped
        // |---|        merged
        // |-------|    toMerge
        //   |-------|  toMerge
        // 
        // We don't have to consider this case, because we have sorted the intervals by `start`.
        //     |-----|  merged
        // |------|     toMerge

        // Or we can use the following function to check if overlapped.
        // if (overlapped(merged, toMerge)) {
        if (toMerge[0] <= merged[1]) {
            merged[0] = minOf(merged[0], toMerge[0])
            merged[1] = maxOf(merged[1], toMerge[1])
        } else {
            // not overlap
            merged = toMerge
            results.add(merged)
        }
    }
    return results.toTypedArray()
}

// Or we can add `merged` later:
fun merge(intervals: Array<IntArray>): Array<IntArray> {
    Arrays.sort(intervals) { i1, i2 -> i1[0] - i2[0] }
    var merged = intervals[0]
    val results = mutableListOf<IntArray>()
    for (i in 1 until intervals.size) {
        val toMerge = intervals[i]

        if (overlapped(merged, toMerge)) {
            merged[0] = minOf(merged[0], toMerge[0])
            merged[1] = maxOf(merged[1], toMerge[1])
        } else {
            results.add(merged)
            merged = toMerge
        }
    }
    results.add(merged)
    return results.toTypedArray()
}

private fun overlapped(merged: IntArray, toMerge: IntArray): Boolean {
    // Not (Not overlapped) = Overlapped
    return !(
        merged[1] < toMerge[0] ||
        toMerge[1] < merged[0]
    )
}

private fun overlapped(merged: IntArray, toMerge: IntArray): Boolean {
    // Case 1:
    // |----|       merged
    //    |------|  toMerge

    // Case 2:
    //    |------|
    // |----|

    // Case 3:
    //    |---|
    // |---------|

    // Case 4: 
    // |---------|
    //    |---|
    return (
        toMerge[0] in merged[0]..merged[1] ||   // Case 1
        merged[1] in toMerge[0]..toMerge[1] ||  // Case 2
        (toMerge[0] <= merged[0] && merged[1] <= toMerge[1]) || // Case 3
        (merged[0] <= toMerge[0] && toMerge[1] <= merged[1])    // Case 4
    )
}
```

* **Time Complexity**: `O(n lg n)` for sorting, `O(n)` to merge, total time is `O(n lg n)`.
* **Space Complexity**: `O(lg n)` for sorting.

## Pitfalls
There is a pitfall to check if two intervals are overlapped, we can't just check if `merged[0] < toMerge[1] || toMerged[0] < merged[1]`.

```js
     |-------|  merged
|-------|       toMerge

|-------|       merged
     |-------|  toMerge
```

It failed in the following cases:
```js
// toMerge[1] < merged[0], but they are overlapped.
|-------|               merged
          |-------|     toMerge

// toMerge[0] < merged[1], but they are not overlapped.
          |-------|     merged
|-------|               toMerge
```
