## [56. Merge Intervals](https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-intervals/)

The idea is that we sort the array first by the `start`, then iterate every interval and merge. 


Supposes we have two intervals to merge:

```js
sorted intervals = [[x, y], [a, b]]
```
After sorting the intervals by `start`, there are two cases:
1. `x` == `a`
2. `x` < `a`

For case 1. `x` == `a`, we just keep the larger `end`:

```js
[1, 10], [1, 8] => [1, 10]
```

For case 2. `x` < `a`, then there are several different cases:

```js
// Fully Overlapped, just keep the longer interval [1, 4]
[1      4]
   [2 3]

// Partially Overlapped, merged, [1, 5]
[1      4]
     [3    5]

// Adjacent, extended, [1, 5]
[1      4][4 5]

// No Overlap, keep both, [1, 4][6, 8]
[1      4]   [6   8]
```

```kotlin
fun merge(intervals: Array<IntArray>): Array<IntArray> {
    Arrays.sort(intervals) { i1, i2 -> i1[0] - i2[0] }

    val results = mutableListOf<IntArray>()
    var merged = intervals[0]
    results.add(merged)
    for (i in 1 until intervals.size) {
        val toMerge = intervals[i]
        // overlapped
        // |---|     |----|
        //   |----------|
        if (toMerge[0] <= merged[1]) {
            merged[0] = min(merged[0], toMerge[0])
            merged[1] = max(merged[1], toMerge[1])
        } else {
            // not overlap
            merged = toMerge
            results.add(merged)
        }
    }
    return results.toTypedArray()
}
```

* **Time Complexity**: `O(n lg n)` for sorting, `O(n)` to merge, total time is `O(n lg n)`.
* **Space Complexity**: `O(lg n)` for sorting.
