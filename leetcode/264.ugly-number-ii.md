What's the next number? It would be the smallest number **all the previously existing ugly numbers multiplied by 2 or 3, 5** that hasn't shown before.

We start calculating from `1`, the next number is `min(2 * 1, 3 * 1, 5 * 1)` that hasn't shown, that is 2, and you can think that is `dp[n = 2]` which comes from `min(2 * dp[n = 1], 3 * dp[1], 5 * dp[1])`.

Then, what's the next number? Now we only need to consider `min(2 * 2, 3 * 1, 5 * 1)`, that would be `min(2 * dp[2], 3 * dp[1], 5 * dp[1])`, that means we have three pointers (for 2, 3, 5 respectively) points to the previous existing number, then we move the pointer if we use that in the round.

```js
n=1, dp[1] = 1 // base case
// pointer          1          1          1
n=2, dp[2] = min(dp[1] * 2, dp[1] * 3, dp[1] * 5)
           =     dp[1] * 2
// pointer          2          1          1
n=3, dp[4] = min(dp[2] * 2, dp[1] * 3, dp[1] * 5)
           =                dp[1] * 3
// pointer          2          2          1
n=4, dp[4] = min(dp[2] * 2, dp[2] * 3, dp[1] * 5)
           =     dp[2] * 2
// pointer          3          2          1
```

The wrong way to think this problem is that we just maintain the three pointers and move them to the next when selecting it, and we can get the result. But the correct way is that we need to consider the next number **from the previous existing numbers**, and we need to maintain the three pointers to point to the previous existing number.

```js
n=1, 1
n=2, min(2 * 1, 3 * 1, 5 * 1) = 2
n=3, min(2 * 2, 3 * 1, 5 * 1) = 3
n=4, min(2 * 2, 3 * 2, 5 * 1) = 4
n=5, min(2 * 3, 3 * 2, 5 * 1) = 5
n=6, min(2 * 3, 3 * 2, 5 * 2) = 6
        // Which one to select?
n=7, min(2 * 4, 3 * 2, 5 * 2) = 6 // select 2 * 3, wrong answer
         ^^^^^

n=7, min(2 * 3, 3 * 3, 5 * 2) = 9 // select 3 * 2, wrong answer
                ^^^^^
```

```kotlin
fun nthUglyNumber(n: Int): Int {
    if (n == 1) return n
    val dp = IntArray(n + 1)
    dp[1] = 1
    
    // Pointers for 2, 3, 5
    var p2 = 1
    var p3 = 1
    var p5 = 1
    for (i in 2..n) {
        val num2 = dp[p2] * 2
        val num3 = dp[p3] * 3
        val num5 = dp[p5] * 5
        
        dp[i] = minOf(num2, minOf(num3, num5))
        
        // Determine where does dp[i] come from, and increment the pointer
        if (dp[i] == num2) p2++
        if (dp[i] == num3) p3++
        if (dp[i] == num5) p5++
    }
    
    return dp[n]
}
```

* **Time Complexity**: `O(n)`.
* **Space Complexity**: `O(n)`.

### Heap
We maintain a min heap and add `2x`, `3x` and `5x` into heap (make sure avoiding duplicate), the result will be the peek.

```kotlin
fun nthUglyNumber(n: Int): Int {
    val factors = listOf(2L, 3L, 5L)
    val minHeap = PriorityQueue<Long>()
    val seen = hashSetOf<Long>()
    var number = 1L
    minHeap.add(number)
    seen.add(number)
    for (i in 0 until n) {
        number = minHeap.poll()
        factors.forEach { factor ->
            val next = factor * number
            if (!seen.contains(next)) {
                minHeap.add(next)
                seen.add(next)
            }
        }
    }
    return number.toInt()
}
```

* **Time Complexity**: `O(n * lg n)`.
* **Space Complexity**: `O(n)`.
