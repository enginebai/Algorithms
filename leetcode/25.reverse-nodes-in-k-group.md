# [25. Reverse Nodes in k-Group](https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-nodes-in-k-group/)

## Hints
- Can you reverse a sublist of length `k` in a linked list in-place?
- What if the number of nodes left is less than `k`?
- Think about how to connect the reversed group with the rest of the list.

## Breakdowns

> 1. **How do you reverse a segment of a linked list?**

Try to implement a helper function to reverse a segment `[start, end]`.

> 2. **How do you process the list in groups of `k`?**

Iterate through the list, each time checking if there are at least `k` nodes left. If so, reverse them; otherwise, leave the rest as is.

> 3. **How do you connect the reversed groups?**  

After reversing, make sure the previous group's tail points to the new head, and the new tail points to the next group.

## Key Insights
- This is a classic **linked list reversal** problem, but applied in fixed-size groups.
- The **sentinel node** pattern is essential to handle head changes.
- The **in-place reversal** of a sublist is a standard interview pattern.

## Recursive
Recursively reverse the first `k` nodes, then call the function on the rest of the list. If there are fewer than `k` nodes left, leave them as is.

```kotlin
fun reverseKGroup(head: ListNode?, k: Int): ListNode? {
    if (head == null) return null

    var size = 0
    var current = head
    while (current != null) {
        current = current.next
        size++
    }

    // Check if we have enough nodes to reverse
    if (size < k) return head

    // Start to reverse k nodes
    var previous: ListNode? = null
    current = head
    var i = 0
    while (current != null && i < k) {
        val next = current.next
        current.next = previous

        previous = current
        current = next
        i++
    }
    // previous: the last node of the current group, it will be the head of the reversed group
    val reversedHead = previous
    // current: the head of the next group after reversing the current group
    val reversedNext = reverseKGroup(current, k)
    head?.next = reversedNext

    return reversedHead
}

// Or equivalently
fun reverseKGroup(head: ListNode?, k: Int): ListNode? {
    if (head == null) return null
    var i = 0
    var current: ListNode? = head
    while (current != null && i < k) {
        current = current.next
        i++
    }
    // Not enough k nodes to reverse
    if (i < k) return head

    // Start to reverse k nodes
    // First, recursively process the rest of the list
    var previous: ListNode? = reverseKGroup(current, k)
    
    // Now 'previous' holds the head of the reversed remaining part of the list
    // 'current' is reset to the head of the current k-group
    current = head
    i = 0
    while (current != null && i < k) {
        val next = current.next
        current.next = previous
        previous = current
        current = next
        i++
    }
    return previous
}
```

- **Time Complexity**: `O(N)`
- **Space Complexity**: `O(N/k)` for recursion stack (worst case `O(N)` if `k=1`).

## In-place Iterative
We process the list **one group of `k` nodes at a time**, reverse each group in-place, and then reconnect it back into the list. There are several pointers to keep track of:

```js
... -> groupPrev -> groupStart -> ... -> kthNode -> groupNext -> ...
       ^^^^^^^^)    (^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^)    (^^^^^^^^
  previous group            current group           next group
```

We need 4 key pointers in each iteration:
| Pointer       | Description                                                  |
|---------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| `groupPrev`   | Tail of the previous reversed group, it's used to stitch in the new head of current reversed group. Starts at sentinel node. |
| `groupStart`  | Head of the current group to reverse. |
| `kthNode`     | The k-th node in the current group (last node to reverse), it will become the new head after reversal. |
| `groupNext`   | Node after the current group (used to reconnect after reverse) |

The final goals to reverse the current group:
* `groupPrev` should link to `kthNode`.
* `groupStart` should link to `groupNext`.
* Each node in the current group should be reversed.
```js
           |------------------------------|
           |                              v
... -> groupPrev  groupStart -> ... -> kthNode -> groupNext -> ...
                       |                              ^
                       |------------------------------|

// which is equivalent to
... -> groupPrev -> kthNode -> ... -> groupStart -> groupNext -> ...
```

The steps to reverse the current group:

* Step 1.: Find the k-th node in the current group from `groupPrev`.
```js
... -> groupPrev -> groupStart -> node2 -> ...  -> kthNode -> groupNext -> ...
                                                   ^^^^^^^
```

* Step 2.: Reverse the current group: `[groupStart, ... kth]`.
```js
... -> groupPrev -> groupStart -> node2 -> ...  -> kthNode -> groupNext -> ...
                        |-----------------------------|
... -> groupPrev     kthNode -> ... -> node2 -> groupStart -> groupNext -> ...
```

* Step 3.: Stitch in the new head of current reversed group. Now `groupPrev.next` is `groupStart`, we need to link it to `kthNode`. and move `groupPrev` to `groupStart`.
```js
... -> groupPrev -> kthNode -> ... -> node2 -> groupStart -> groupNext -> ...
                                                   |   
                                              **groupPrev  
```

```kotlin
fun reverseKGroup(head: ListNode?, k: Int): ListNode? {
    if (head == null) return null
    val sentinel = ListNode(-1)
    sentinel.next = head
    var groupPrev = sentinel
    while (true) {
        // Get the k-th node, if not enough nodes, break
        var kthNode = getKthNode(groupPrev, k) ?: break

        // Get the head of the current group
        val groupStart = groupPrev.next

        // Preserve the head of the next group
        val groupNext = kthNode?.next

        // Start to reverse the current group   
        var previous: ListNode? = groupNext
        var current: ListNode? = groupStart
        while (current != groupNext) {
            val next = current?.next
            current?.next = previous
            previous = current
            current = next
        }

        // Connect the previous group with the reversed current group
        groupPrev.next = kthNode
        // Update the previous group to the current group
        groupPrev = groupStart
    }
    return sentinel.next
}

// Move k times to get the k-th node
private fun getKthNode(head: ListNode?, k: Int): ListNode? {
    var current = head
    for (i in 0 until k) {
        current = current?.next ?: return null
    }
    return current
}
```

### Example
```js
// Original list
k = 3
s -> 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6 -> 7

// Locate the k-th node, and preserve the head of the next group
s -> 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6 -> 7
*              *    *
groupPrev      k    groupNext

// Start to reverse the current group
s -> 1 <- 2 <- 3    4 -> 5 -> 6 -> 7
     |              ^
     |--------------|

// Connect the previous group with the reversed current group
val next = groupPrev.next   // groupPrev = s, next = 1
groupPrev.next = kthNode    // s -> 3
groupPrev = next            // groupPrev = 1

// The result after the first iteration
s -> 3 -> 2 -> 1 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6 -> 7

// ----------------
// Continue with the next group
s -> 3 -> 2 -> 1 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6 -> 7
               *              *    *
               groupPrev      k    groupNext
```

- **Time Complexity**: `O(N)`, where `N` is the number of nodes (each node is visited and reversed once).
- **Space Complexity**: `O(1)` (in-place, only a few pointers used).

## Stack
The key ideas are the same as above, we just use a stack to reverse the nodes in each group. For each iteration, we push `k` nodes into the stack, and then pop them out to reverse the group. We keep track of two pointers:
* `current`: The current node in the list. We move it `k` times to push it into the stack and check if there are enough `k` nodes left.
* `newCurrent`: The last node to build the new list after reversing the current group.

```kotlin
fun reverseKGroup(head: ListNode?, k: Int): ListNode? {
    if (head == null) return null
    val stack = Stack<ListNode>()
    val sentinel = ListNode(-1)
    sentinel.next = head
    var current = head
    var newCurrent = sentinel
    while (true) {
        var i = 0
        // Push `k` nodes into the stack
        while (i < k && current != null) {
            stack.push(current)
            current = current.next
            i++
        }
        // Not enough nodes to reverse
        if (i < k) {
            break
        }
        // Pop `k` nodes from the stack and build the new list
        while (stack.isNotEmpty()) {
            val node = stack.pop()
            newCurrent.next = node
            newCurrent = node
        }
        /**
         * Connect the new list with the next group
         * This is required otherwise the last node of the new list will point to
         * the last node of the current group, which will cause a cycle.
         * For example, list: 1 -> 2
         * stack = [1, 2]
         * newCurrent = 1 and break the loop, 1 still points to 2.
         */
        newCurrent.next = current
    }
    return sentinel.next
}
```

- **Time Complexity**: `O(N)`, where `N` is the number of nodes (each node is visited and reversed once).
- **Space Complexity**: `O(k)` for the stack.

## 尾插法
> TODO: The following solution is not correct.
```kotlin
fun reverseKGroup(head: ListNode?, k: Int): ListNode? {
    if (head == null) return null
    val sentinel = ListNode(-1)
    sentinel.next = head

    var current = head
    var newCurrent = sentinel
    while (true) {
        var i = 0
        var start = current
        // Move to tail of current group
        while (i < k - 1 && current != null) {
            current = current.next
            i++
        }
        if (i < k - 1 || current == null) break

        val nextStart = current?.next

        // s -> 2 -> 1
        val tail = current!!
        newCurrent.next = tail
        newCurrent = tail

        // 1 -> 2
        // 2 -> 1
        while (start != tail) {
            newCurrent.next = start
            newCurrent = newCurrent.next!!
            start = start?.next
        }

        // Move to the head of next group
        newCurrent.next = nextStart
        current = nextStart
    }
    return sentinel.next
}
```

## Edge Cases
- **List length < k**:  
  The last group should not be reversed.  
  *How to avoid?* Always check if there are at least `k` nodes before reversing.
- **k = 1**:  
  The list should remain unchanged.
- **k = list length**:  
  The entire list is reversed once.
- **List with exactly k nodes**:  
  Should be reversed once.

## Pitfalls
- **Off-by-one errors**:  
  When finding the k-th node, make sure to move `k` times from the current node, not `k-1`.
- **Losing references**:  
  Always keep track of the next group's head before reversing.
- **Not reconnecting the reversed group properly**:  
  After reversal, connect the previous group's tail to the new head, and the new tail to the next group.
