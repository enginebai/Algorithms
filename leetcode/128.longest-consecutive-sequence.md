## [128. Longest Consecutive Sequence](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-consecutive-sequence/)

For every number `x`, we can extend two side and check if `x - 1`, `x - 2`, ... and `x + 1`, `x + 2`, ... so on. But actually, we can check `x + 1`, `x + 2`, ... direction only, we've check if `x` is consecutive sequence when number is `x - 1`.

```kotlin
fun longestConsecutive(nums: IntArray): Int {
    val hashSet = hashSetOf<Int>()
    for (num in nums) {
        hashSet.add(num)
    }

    var maxStreak = 0
    for (i in 0 until nums.size) {
        val num = nums[i]
        // This is the key, we only check ascending direction.
        // If we have num - 1 which is consecutive to num, answer will check at num - 1 iteration, not current iteration.
        if (!hashSet.contains(num - 1)) {
            var next = num + 1
            while (hashSet.contains(next)) {
                next++
