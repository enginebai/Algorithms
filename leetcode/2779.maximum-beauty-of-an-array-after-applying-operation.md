# [2779. Maximum Beauty of an Array After Applying Operation](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-beauty-of-an-array-after-applying-operation/description/)

## Test Cases
### Edge / Corner Cases
* Single element: `[1]`.
* All elements are the same: `[1, 1, 1, 1]`.
* Huge gap between elements: `[1, 1000000000]`.

## Breakdowns
> 1. How to find the longest subsequence (not subarray) that consists of the same elements?

```js
nums = [1, 2, 3, 2, 3, 2]
        |                   // For 1   
           |-----------|    // For 2
              |-----|       // For 3
```

> 2. If the array is sorted, the answer is?

```js
nums = [1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3]
        |                   // For 1
           |-----|          // For 2
                    |--|    // For 3
        
```

We can use a sliding window or the same approach as above.

> 3. If the array is sorted, and we can change the element in the range `[nums[i] - k..nums[i] + k]`, the answer is?

This is the solution to the problem, see below.

## Prework + Key Insight
The problem is to find the maximum length of the longest **subsequence** consisting of equal elements. We can modify the elements to make them to be equal, the order of the elements doesn't matter. `[3, 1]` could be changed to `[3, 3]` or `[1, 1]`, the same result of `[1, 3]`. We can **sort** the array so that the closer (equal) elements can be grouped together easily. We can have a window size `2 * k` (`<--k--|--k-->`) to find the longest subarray. 

**Idea 1: Longest subsequence -> Sort -> Longest subarray.**

After sorting the array, how can we decide if the two adjacent numbers can be changed to be equal? 

**Idea 2: If the `diff(A, B) <= 2 * k`, then we can change the two numbers to be equal.** 
```js
|--|--|--|--|--|--|
A           B
 ------>
     <------   
      X // The equal number can be changed to be equal

// diff(A, B) > 2 * k, it's impossible to make the two numbers to be equal.
|--|--|--|--|--|--|
A                 B
 ------>   <------
```


## Binary Search
We iterate all the elements and search its upper bound (`2 * k`) that the input array can cover. The maximum length of the subarray is the answer.

```js
k = 2
1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 5, 6, 6, 7, 9
^                 * // Upper bound of 1 + 2 * k     
|--------------|    // 1 and 5 can be changed to be equal with k = 2, [1, 5] => [3, 3]
         ^                 *
         |--------------|
```
```kotlin
fun maximumBeauty(nums: IntArray, k: Int): Int {
    nums.sort()
    var ans = 0
    for (i in nums.indices) {
        val upperBound = binarySearch(nums, nums[i] + 2 * k)
        ans = maxOf(ans, upperBound - i)
    }   
    return ans
}

// Find the first element that condition: "A[i] > target" (the current implementation)
// Or
// We can find the last element that condition: "A[i] <= target"
private fun binarySearch(nums: IntArray, target: Int): Int {
    var left = 0
    var right = nums.size - 1
    while (left <= right) {
        val middle = left + (right - left) / 2
        val meet = nums[middle] > target
        if (meet) {
            right = middle - 1
        } else {
            left = middle + 1
        }
    }
    return left
}
```

* **Time Complexity:** `O(n log n)` for sorting and binary search.
* **Space Complexity:** `O(log n)` for sorting.

## Sliding Window
The two numbers can be changed to be equal if `diff(A, B) <= 2 * k` from above: It's impossible to make the two numbers to be equal if `diff(A, B) > 2 * k`. To find the maximum length of the subarray, we can use a sliding window in sorted array.

* Window: The number in this window can be changed to be equal, that is the the maximum difference of the two numbers in the window is `<= 2 * k`.
* We expand the window until the condition is broken the condition. Then we shrink the window from the left until the condition is satisfied.

```kotlin
fun maximumBeauty(nums: IntArray, k: Int): Int {
    nums.sort()
    var left = 0
    var ans = 0
    var maxCount = 0
    for (right in nums.indices) {
        // Shrinking the window when breakding the condition: diff(A, B) <= 2 * k
        while (nums[right] - nums[left] > 2 * k) {
            left++
        }
        ans = maxOf(ans, right - left + 1)
    }
    return ans
}
```

* **Time Complexity:** `O(n log n)` for sorting.
* **Space Complexity:** `O(log n)` for sorting.
