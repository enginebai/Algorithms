# [1578. Minimum Time to Make Rope Colorful](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-time-to-make-rope-colorful/)

## Hints
- What should you do when you see consecutive balloons of the same color?
- Is it always optimal to keep the balloon with the highest removal time in a group?

## Breakdowns
> 1. How do you ensure no two adjacent balloons have the same color?

- For every group of consecutive balloons with the same color, you must remove all but one. The optimal one to keep is the one with the highest `neededTime`.

> 2. How do you efficiently calculate the minimum total removal time?

- For each group, sum all `neededTime` and subtract the maximum in the group. Repeat for all groups.

## Key Insights
- This is a classic "group by consecutive" problem, where you process runs of the same value.
- The greedy choice is always to keep the balloon with the highest removal cost in each group, removing the rest.
- You can solve this in a single pass with two pointers or a running max/sum.
- This pattern appears in other problems like [1446. Consecutive Characters](1446.consecutive-characters.md).

## Two Pointers (Group by Consecutive) + Greedy
**Idea!!** For each group of consecutive balloons with same color, remove all but the one with the highest `neededTime`.

We try to group the consecutive balloons with the same color, and remove the balloons of the same color by removing all but keep the balloon with the maximum time.

```js
a, a, a
2, 3, 1
```

We must remove 1, 2 and keep 3, total cost is sum of group - max of group, which is `1 + 2 + 3 - 3 = 3`.

> If we have repeated characters, we need to remove all of them except one - the "most expensive" character to remove.

```kotlin
fun minCost(colors: String, neededTime: IntArray): Int {
    val n = colors.length
    var i = 0
    var totalTime = 0
    while (i < n) {
        // Skip different color
        if (i == n - 1 || (i + 1 < n && colors[i] != colors[i + 1])) {
            i++
            continue
        }

        // Group: same color, remove all, but maximum time.
        // I made a mistake here: I just remove the minimum time, but failed 
        // the case that there are multiple balloons with different times.
        var maxTime = neededTime[i]
        var timeSum = neededTime[i]
        i++
        while (i < n && colors[i - 1] == colors[i]) {
            maxTime = maxOf(maxTime, neededTime[i])
            timeSum += neededTime[i]
            i++
        }
        totalTime += (timeSum - maxTime)
    }
    return totalTime
}

// Or equivalently, this is the same approach as discussion, but not group by consecutive.
fun minCost(colors: String, neededTime: IntArray): Int {
    var totalCost = 0
    var groupSum = neededTime.first()
    var groupMax = neededTime.first()
    for (i in 1 until colors.length) {
        if (colors[i - 1] == colors[i]) {
            groupSum += neededTime[i]
            groupMax = maxOf(groupMax, neededTime[i])
        } else {
            totalCost += groupSum - groupMax
            groupSum = neededTime[i]
            groupMax = neededTime[i]
        }
    }
    totalCost += groupSum - groupMax
    return totalCost
}
```
- **Time Complexity**: `O(N)`, where `N` is the length of `colors`.
- **Space Complexity**: `O(1)`.

## Edge Cases
- Single balloon: answer is `0` (should not remove anything).
- All balloons are unique colors: answer is `0`.
- All balloons are the same color: remove all but the one with the highest `neededTime`.
- Large input with many consecutive groups: make sure to reset group tracking correctly.
