# Key Patterns and Approaches for String Problems

Based on the problems in `problems/string-problems.md`, here is a summary of the key patterns and approaches for solving string problems.

String problems involve manipulating, analyzing, or transforming sequences of characters. They often require pattern recognition, character frequency analysis, and efficient substring operations.

### 1. Basic String Operations

Fundamental string manipulation techniques that form the building blocks for more complex problems.

#### 1.1 Character-Level Operations
*   **Core Idea:** Process strings character by character, applying transformations or validations.
*   **Key Applications:**
    *   Character reversal and case manipulation
    *   Frequency counting and analysis
    *   Character-based validation and filtering
*   **Examples:** [344. Reverse String](../leetcode/344.reverse-string.md), [387. First Unique Character in a String](../leetcode/387.first-unique-character-in-a-string.md).

#### 1.2 String Transformation
*   **Core Idea:** Convert strings based on specific rules or patterns.
*   **Key Techniques:**
    *   Stack-based processing for nested operations
    *   State machine approach for complex transformations
    *   Rule-based character replacement or removal
*   **Examples:** [1544. Make The String Great](../leetcode/1544.make-the-string-great.md) (remove adjacent opposite case pairs).

### 2. String Comparison and Matching

Compare strings based on various criteria such as content, structure, or patterns.

#### 2.1 Anagram Detection
*   **Core Idea:** Determine if two strings contain the same characters with the same frequencies.
*   **Key Approaches:**
    *   **Sorting:** Sort both strings and compare - O(n log n)
    *   **Frequency Counting:** Count character frequencies and compare - O(n)
    *   **Hash Table:** Use character counts as fingerprints
*   **Examples:** [242. Valid Anagram](../leetcode/242.valid-anagram.md).

#### 2.2 String Equivalence with Constraints
*   **Core Idea:** Check if strings can be made equal under specific transformation rules.
*   **Key Approaches:**
    *   Count allowed differences/swaps
    *   Track positions of mismatches
    *   Validate transformation feasibility
*   **Examples:** [1790. Check if One String Swap Can Make Strings Equal](../leetcode/1790.check-if-one-string-swap-can-make-strings-equal.md), [859. Buddy Strings](../leetcode/859.buddy-strings.md).

### 3. Subsequence and Substring Patterns

Work with contiguous (substring) or non-contiguous (subsequence) portions of strings.

#### 3.1 Subsequence Matching
*   **Core Idea:** Check if one string can be formed by selecting characters from another string in order.
*   **Key Approach:**
    *   Use two pointers: one for each string
    *   Advance target pointer only when characters match
    *   Success when target pointer reaches end
*   **Examples:** [792. Number of Matching Subsequences](../leetcode/792.number-of-matching-subsequences.md).

#### 3.2 Substring Analysis
*   **Core Idea:** Analyze contiguous portions of strings for specific properties.
*   **Key Techniques:**
    *   Sliding window for fixed-length analysis
    *   Hash set for substring existence checking
    *   Rolling hash for efficient substring comparison
*   **Examples:** [1461. Check If a String Contains All Binary Codes of Size K](../leetcode/1461.check-if-a-string-contains-all-binary-codes-of-size-k.md).

### 4. Pattern Recognition and Validation

Identify patterns or validate string structures according to specific rules.

#### 4.1 Format Validation
*   **Core Idea:** Check if strings conform to expected formats or patterns.
*   **Key Approaches:**
    *   Regular expression matching
    *   State machine validation
    *   Character-by-character rule checking
*   **Applications:** Email validation, phone number formatting, syntax checking.

#### 4.2 Structural Analysis
*   **Core Idea:** Analyze the internal structure of strings for patterns or properties.
*   **Key Techniques:**
    *   Frequency analysis for character distribution
    *   Position-based analysis for structural patterns
    *   Mathematical properties for validation

### 5. String Construction and Generation

Build strings based on specific rules or constraints.

#### 5.1 Constraint-Based Construction
*   **Core Idea:** Build strings that satisfy multiple constraints simultaneously.
*   **Key Approaches:**
    *   Greedy construction with constraint checking
    *   Backtracking for complex constraint satisfaction
    *   Priority-based character selection
*   **Applications:** Password generation, string rearrangement with constraints.

#### 5.2 Pattern-Based Generation
*   **Core Idea:** Generate strings following specific patterns or templates.
*   **Key Techniques:**
    *   Template filling with variable substitution
    *   Rule-based character sequence generation
    *   Combinatorial string construction

### Advanced String Algorithms (For Reference)

While not directly covered in the basic problem set, these are important string algorithms to know:

#### Pattern Matching Algorithms
*   **KMP (Knuth-Morris-Pratt):** Efficient pattern searching with O(n+m) complexity
*   **Boyer-Moore:** Skip characters when pattern doesn't match
*   **Rabin-Karp:** Rolling hash for multiple pattern matching

#### String Processing Techniques
*   **Trie (Prefix Tree):** Efficient prefix-based operations
*   **Suffix Array:** Sorting suffixes for advanced string operations
*   **Z-Algorithm:** Finding all occurrences of pattern in linear time

### Key String Problem Patterns

1. **Character Frequency Analysis:**
   - Use hash maps or arrays for counting
   - Applications: anagrams, character validation, frequency matching

2. **Two-Pointer Techniques:**
   - Subsequence matching, palindrome checking
   - One pointer per string or start/end of same string

3. **Sliding Window on Strings:**
   - Fixed-size substring analysis
   - Variable-size window for optimization problems

4. **Stack-Based Processing:**
   - Nested structure handling (parentheses, tags)
   - Adjacent character operations

5. **String Transformation Rules:**
   - Case conversions, character replacements
   - Rule-based string modifications

### Common String Manipulation Techniques

1. **In-Place Operations:**
   - Modify strings without extra space (when possible)
   - Careful with language-specific string mutability rules

2. **StringBuilder/StringBuffer:**
   - Efficient for multiple string concatenations
   - Avoid O(nÂ²) behavior from repeated concatenation

3. **Character Array Conversion:**
   - Convert to array for easier manipulation
   - Convert back to string when needed

### Edge Cases to Consider

1. **Empty Strings:** Handle zero-length inputs gracefully
2. **Single Character:** Many algorithms have special cases for length 1
3. **Case Sensitivity:** Clarify whether comparisons are case-sensitive
4. **Unicode/Special Characters:** Consider character encoding issues
5. **Very Long Strings:** Memory and time complexity considerations

### Summary of Key Approaches

1. **Understand the Problem Type:** Is it comparison, transformation, pattern matching, or construction?

2. **Choose Appropriate Data Structures:** 
   - Hash maps for frequency counting
   - Stacks for nested operations
   - Two pointers for sequence matching

3. **Consider Time/Space Trade-offs:** 
   - Sorting vs hashing for anagram detection
   - In-place vs auxiliary space for transformations

4. **Handle String Immutability:** 
   - Be aware of language-specific string behavior
   - Use appropriate mutable structures when needed

5. **Master Core Patterns:** 
   - Frequency analysis, two-pointer matching, sliding window
   - These patterns appear in many string problems

6. **Practice Edge Case Handling:** 
   - Empty inputs, single characters, special characters
   - Robust code handles all valid inputs correctly

String problems often combine multiple techniques and require careful consideration of character-level details. Success comes from recognizing patterns, choosing efficient algorithms, and handling edge cases properly.
